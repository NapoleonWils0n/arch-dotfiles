# designing collaboration - home

I’m using this space to evolve a framework for thinking about
collaboration for social benefit, and enterprise, and the extent to
which processes can be designed. So far:\
-   A couple of programmes that I know personally and that I’ve analysed: [RSA Networks](RSA.md) and [Social Innovation Camp](Social%20Innovation%20Camp.md)
-   Some [lessons](lessons.md) from those
-   Some general [principles](principles.md)
-   A set of collaboration [terms](Collaboration%20terms.md)
\
This wiki is currently closed - that is, I’m the sole author. However, I
would be very interested to hear from others in the same field, and will
develop a list of resources. Hopefully we can collaborate in developing
frameworks as shared thinking emerges.\

I also blog at\

If you are interested in this work, please email me - but the wiki is
not open to other members at this stage.\
