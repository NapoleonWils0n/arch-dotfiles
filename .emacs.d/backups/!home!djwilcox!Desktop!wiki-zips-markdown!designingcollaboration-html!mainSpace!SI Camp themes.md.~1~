# designing collaboration - SI Camp themes

Below are some themes and lessons I’ve drawn from [my experience of Social Innovation Camp, and the evaluation](Social%20innovation%20Camp.md).\
\
**Summary of SI Camp**\
A group of three social entrepreneurs, disatisfied with the ability of
conventional charities to use new technologies for social innovation,
secured funding from [NESTA](http://www.nesta.org.uk/)
for a Social Innovation Camp over a weekend in London in April 2008. The
aim was to bring together those who were working at the sharp end of
social problems with web designers and developers who could help create
solutions.\
Their call for ideas produced 77 project proposals, which the
organisation cut back to 20 for submission to an advisory group. From
these six projects were chosen.\
Over the weekend some 80 people worked together to produce prototypes,
which were presented at a Show and Tell session. One winner and one
runner up were given prizes of £3000 and £2000. An additional project
was developed during the weekend, and accepted as part of the process.\
The weekend, and the overall process, produced enormous energy and
connections going beyond the two days. In September four of the seven
projects were still under development.\
NESTA is funding a further SI Camp in December 2008. The organisers have
[set out their thinking](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157) about
web-enabled social innovation, and put out a [call for ideas](http://www.sicamp.org/?p=193).\

### Themes

These themes are framed around the [set of collaboration terms here.](Collaboration%20terms.md)\
See also SI Camp organiser [Anna Maybank’s lessons](http://www.sicamp.org/?p=152), which I
summarised as:\
-   **Make use of all the brain power**: unlike conventional conferences, everyone can join in
-   **Get the right people along**: the organisers arranged a good mix of skills and profiled people attending
-   **Create moments of self-organising**: time was set aside for self-organising
-   **Set yourself a goal**: participants had to build prototypes to show everyone within 48 hours
-   **First impressions count**: the start of the event was social, with everyone offered sheets of labels to tag each other
-   **The importance of fun and fear**: the event was, friendly, sociable - with a strong element of competition
-   **Make your tech invisible**: food, coffee and wiki all worked
-   **Embrace the unknown**: mix careful pre-planning with self organising on the day, and be prepared to make changes and go with the unexpected
-   **It’s really about people, not technology**: there’s no substitute for bring people face-to-face to work out how technology can meet social needs.

\
**Purpose**. The goal for everyone was very clear throughout the
process: work together to develop web-enabled solutions to social
problems that you have defined. The organisers were also clear about
[their philosophy](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157)
of the way that social technology can help people create big changes
from small beginnings.\
\
**Control**. While the SI Camp organisers created a strong framework and
process, they left people to organise themselves into teams, and were
prepared to allow an additional project to develop during the weekend.
They planned carefully, then left things open and flexible.\
\
**Ownership**. There was no attempt by organisers to claim ownership of
ideas or the model. After the event they encouraged people to take the
SI Camp model and [apply it elsewhere](http://www.sicamp.org/?p=152). The ethos of
the event generated by the organisers encouraged everyone to share their
ideas.\
\
**Attitude**. Everyone turned up with a shared expectation of
collaboration, and the format of the event reinforced that. Sociability
helped.\
\
**Communication**. The [blog](http://www.sicamp.org/)
kept people up date before, at and after the event, and participants
were able to communicate through
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sicamp) and a
[Backnetwork](http://sicamp.backnetwork.com/) online
system (inivitation only). This worked well because most people were
confident online - and also meeting face-to-face.\
\
**Leadership**. The SI Camp organisers created the vision, raised
funding, set the terms of engagement, and the process to select
projects. They then moved into a more facilitative mode of working and
created the self-organising space within which people could develop
their projects.\
\
**Motivation**. While the prizes were small - £2000 and £1000 for winner
and runner-up - people appeared motivated by the chance to work
collaboratively in a friendly, fun atmosphere to create some innovative
projects.\
\
**Online system**. There was no purpose-built online system: the
organisers used Wordpress, Backnetwork and Twitter. This meant that
costs were low and there was no substantial lead-in time.\
\
**Project development**. The process for gathering ideas, choosing and
then developing projects during the weekend succeeded in producing seven
strong projects. However, the critieria by which projects were chosen
were not particularly clear, and there was relatively little support
after the Camp for projects. It may be that the second phase of
development from October 2008 - with monthly meetups around the December
event - provides the opportunity to build networks of support and
generally keep the buzz going.\
\
**Networks and teams.** SI Camp has the potential to develop networks of
people interested in web-enabled social innovation, while recognising
the need for more tightly-formed teams to develop projects.\
\
**Events**. The next phase of SI Camp development recogises the need for
people to continue to meet to maintain momentum. While the projects are
web-enabled, the process is substantially face-to-face.\
\
**Diversity**. While there was a fair spread of interests at SI Camp,
most of those attending were young, tech-savvy people. The next phase
offers the opportunity to recruit more widely - but will this make it
more difficult to get the rapid bonding of interests? Is a wider spread
of interests and backgrounds important if the SI Camp model is to make a
major impact on social problems?\
\
**Trust**. The open, participative nature of the process appeared to
create the conditions within which people were prepared readily to share
their ideas.\
\
**Overall model**. The [Big Idea](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157) behind Social
Innovation Camp is that web technologies enable people to develop
innovative projects outside traditional institutions. They can build
networks with others and “this allows an individual to affect change by
themselves on a scale that previously would have been difficult to
achieve.” SI Camp piloted an accelerated face-to-face demonstration of
how this can produce a lot of ideas and some developed projects. The
monthly meetups and a further camp may begin to show how far the
approach can scale up, particularly if others take up the invitation to
“steal” the idea and run their own camps.
