*The ideas below were developed in May 2012, since when the idea of
relaunching OpenRSA has been put on hold. On reflection, and from a wide
range of conversations, it may be more productive to focus development
of an innovation space to pilot ideas for the RSA we would like to see.
The next RSA. David Wilcox*\

## []()Overall challenge and OpenRSA role {#toc0}

The overall challenge that OpenRSA is addressing - in line with [our
objectives](http://openrsa.wikispaces.com/about){.wiki_link} - is:\
\
*How can RSA Fellows contribute to the organisation’s mission - and
benefit from the experience in ways that suit their needs as well?*\
\
The Fellowship survey highlight networking as a high priority - so we
are working on the basis that our objective could be achieved in part by
helping Fellows develop personbal networking in a way that also builds
networks with RSA. See [Collaborating towards a more fully networked
RSA.](http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement/forum/topics/collaborating-towards-a-more-fully-networked-rsa){.wiki_link_ext}\
\
We aim to explore that challenge on three fronts. How to:\
1.  Help Fellows understand what’s on offer from RSA, and the part that
    they can play.
2.  Facilite more opportunities for collaboration between Fellows.
3.  Connect Fellow-led initiatives with others outside the organisation.

## []()The workshop as part of an exploration {#toc1}

Here’s some ideas, based in part on explorations I (David Wilcox) have
been running with others [at
socialreporters.net](http://www.socialreporters.net/?page_id=552){.wiki_link_ext}\
\
**Set up phase**\
-   Liaise with RSA staff and any relevant Fellowship groups.
-   Start our blog at OpenRSA.org, and report our activities there and
    on [RSAFellowship.com](http://rsafellowship.com/){.wiki_link_ext}
    and the Linkedin Group.
-   Develop some questions and answers about Fellowship to supplement
    [guidance already on offer](RSA%20Fellowship.html){.wiki_link}. Dr
    Bob Rollins [has made a start
    here](http://rsafellowship.com/profiles/blogs/how-might-new-fellows-be-better-supported-when-they-first-join){.wiki_link_ext}.
-   Report on any network development in prospect, on the blog

\
**Developing workshop issues and ideas**\
-   Crowdsource some talking points - [starters
    here](Talking%20points.html){.wiki_link} - and initial ideas to
    address the issues (the reason for the Talking Points - rather than
    jumping straight to ideas - is that the issues are highly complex,
    and we need to get some shared understanding of them.)

\
**At the workshop**\
-   Provide an update on the RSA context, from the above work
-   Use the talking points and initial ideas to generate and prioritise
    more ideas
-   Sort the ideas into those that can be taken forward by Fellows on
    their own; those that can be achieve collaboratively with staff; and
    those that can only by done by staff and Board (thanks to the
    [Social Spaces Skills
    Game](http://www.collaborate.so/games/){.wiki_link_ext} for
    this categorisation)
-   Form groups around some Fellow-led ideas

\
**After the workshop**\
This will depend on the pre-workshop and workshop discussions, but we
would expect to move forward with some practical action on the
Fellow-led ideas.\
