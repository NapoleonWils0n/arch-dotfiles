The RSA is the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures
& Commerce and ‘works to remove the barriers to social progress’. It is
however a “members only” club. The OpenRSA group is facilitating
member/non member networks as well as the use of social media within the
RSA (Yours truly is not a member, but got interested in what this group
was trying to do after reading a post about it from [Ian
Delaney](http://twopointouch.com/2007/07/10/rsa-and-social-media/){.wiki_link_ext}
and joined the Facebook group).\
\
Anyway, this was a 1/2 day workshop to look at how social media can be
used by and for the RSA. It is an organisation that is in the process of
changing itself, so it was interesting to think about how social media
can be used in such a workshop environment.\
\
The first session was about how to use social media, and the various
working parties came up with a useful composite model - in essence an
“Intellectual sharecycle” using:\
\
\
- appropriate tools – “dating” profiles a la facebook for member
locations but more interactive comms than Facebook uses for comms,
projects.\
\
- Use “wikinomics” – leverage the power of networks, members as resource
networks, as much as individuals\
\
- Use this to drive the idea space, ideashare, discover and stimulate –
coalesce around ideas. Also use Social media tools around the various
conversations (about ideas & projects)\
\
\
Issues to be managed are:\
\
\
– Info overload, too much stuff\
\
- Importance of ensuring offline is represented - Reaching older/offline
members and working with them\
\
- Don’t rely on FB – not perfect, not forever\
\
\
Tip of hat to [Bill
Thompson](http://www.thebillblog.com/billblog/){.wiki_link_ext} for
these notes. The second session was a “select your topic and go host it”
style, we talked about tools required for the OpenRSA to work. The
bigger discussion of course turned out to be around “what do you want
this all to do”, and that turns out to be to allow members (and others)
to find kindred spirits and coalesce around proposals for action. And
that, fundamentally, is about creating and engaging communities of
interest, prioritising competing projects, and securing resources.
Interesting discussion, classic conflicts emerged between:\
\
\
- Functionality vs Ease of Use\
- Completeness vs Complexity\
- Facilitated Service vs Self Regulation\
- Push vs Pull information of people’s interests.\
- Trust (fewer) vs open-ness (many)\
- Export data to other platforms vs platform for importing diverse data\
\
\
\
As well as the technical / operational discussions, other issues raised
were:\
\
\
- How to judge project desirability - and potentially secure resources -
some very creative ideas including Seedcamp style pitching, “wisdom of
crowds” voting, and - simplest approach - see how many people sign up to
it and how much activity there is)\
- How to project manage various projects online\
- How to facilitate trust in the network, and reward contributory
behaviour.\

All good questions, and much food for thought for the next session one
hopes….
