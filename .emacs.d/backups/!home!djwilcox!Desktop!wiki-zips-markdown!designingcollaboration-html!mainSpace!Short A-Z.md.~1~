# designing collaboration - Short A-Z

The aim here is to develop a minimum set of terms useful in developing a
framework for describing collaboration. As such they are no much
definitions as a start on a working language for collaboration that
might be used across disciplines and sectors.\
\
### **Collaboration terms**

**Attitude**: whether or not people are disposed to be collaborative, in
the current context\
\
**Beneficiaries**: people whose need is being met. If they pay for that,
they are customers\
\
**Collaboration**: working together to a common purpose\
\
**Context** or situation: where we are collaborating, and what else is
happening there\
\
**Control**: the system by which permissions and rewards are given and
protocols enforced\
\
**Diversity**: how different are the people involved in the situation\
\
**Ecosystem**: stakeholders touched by the collaboration process and its
results\
\
**Events**: when group interactions take place\

\
**Framework** for collaboration: a set of assumptions, concepts, values,
and practices for describing collaboration.\
\
**Group**: people interacting to some purpose, which may be short term\
\

other elements of the collaboration framework designed to deliver an
agreed purpose\
\

\
**Online systems and tools** for collaboration: the means of

\
**Protocols**: the rules of behaviour, permissions and reward systems -
how we do things around here\

\
**Power**: power to is the ability to achieve purpose; power over is the

on a spectrum of tell, sell, consult, co-design, co-create (where only
the last two are collaborative)\
