 [2016-09-13 Tue 15:40] Unlock Your Locked Ghost Account
 01 MAY 2014 on Ghost
 I setup Ghost a little over a week ago, thinking my first post would be about the setup. Tonight, tired but not wanting to go to bed, I decided to work on the "How to setup Ghost" blog post. Foolishly, I had forgotten my password, having only really logged in once. After five attempts at logging in I am locked out. And of course I did not setup the email functionality, so there is no hope in resetting that way.

 So here I am, locked out of my new blog, wanting to blog. If you have found yourself in a similar situation then you can follow theses steps to unlock your account so you can enter the correct password after drinking some coffee. (If you don't remember your password, coffee or not, this likely won't help you much.)

 First we will need to install sqlite3, in case you don't already have it (I didn't):

 $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3

 You will then want to navigate to your installation directory, typical locations include /var/www/ghost/, from there you want ./content/data, so let's go there:

 $ cd /var/www/ghost/content/data/

 Here you'll find ghost.db and README.md. We are going to be changing some values in the database with sqlite3. (Surprise, surprise.) Let's fire up the database, making sure to login as root (with sudo), else we'll be unable to change anything, as it'll be readonly:

 $ sudo sqlite3 ghost.db

 We then can check our users and see that we really are locked out:

 sqlite> select * from users;

 This will display a single long line, likely with a value of "locked" somewhere in it. That is what we've come here to change. We want to set it to the value "active", to do so run:

 sqlite> update users set status = "active";

 We can check that we were successful with another:

 sqlite> select * from users;

 After confirmation, excite sqlite3 with:

 sqlite> .exit

 Now, navigate back your sign in page, take another sip of that coffee, and enter your password correctly this time. Now that you've hopefully logged in, it's time to actually setup that mailing functionality! (Or if you're anything like me, not worry about it, since you now know how to unlock yourself in the event of further stupidity lack of coffee...)

[2016-08-07 Sun 15:55] Emacs as Daemon on OS X using Launchd

If you’re running Emacs 23, you can run Emacs As Daemon via OS X’s launchd. The easiest solution is to use a tool like Lingon to create the plist file or can create one manually like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> 
     <plist version="1.0">
      <dict> 
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>gnu.emacs.daemon</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</string>
          <string>--daemon</string>
        </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>ServiceDescription</key>
       <string>Gnu Emacs Daemon</string>
       <key>UserName</key>
       <string>[YOUR USERNAME HERE]</string>
      </dict>
    </plist>
#+END_EXAMPLE

This can then be installed in /Library/LaunchAgents and loaded via:

    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist

[2016-08-19 Fri 00:53] Headings
It's all about headings in org. Headings such as this are created with * (stars). The number of stars defines the depth of the heading. Pressing <TAB> on headings will minimize/maximize them. Pressing tab multiple times in a row on headings with subheadings will maximize each subheading by depth corresponding to the number of times you pressed <TAB>.

Subheadings

Subheadings can nest within other headings such as this one. This is really convenient for organizing stuff.

"TODO"s (C-c C-t)
TODO's are created by starting headers with the keyword TODO or DONE. You can also create one with C-c C-t on a header. They are meant to represent tasks you wish to create within your organizational document. These can be helpful when planning out projects or assignments.

The TODO cycle

You can turn an existing header into a TODO item by cycling its TODO status. The shortcut for this is C-c C-t (t for todo).

Non-TODO -> TODO -> DONE -> Non-TODO … (with C-c C-t).

Lists
You can create bullets with the - (dash), numbered bullets or lists with #. (number[dot]). Tabbing multiple times changes the indentation of the bullet, but only if there is no text yet. Tabbing multiple levels can get confusing, but if you remember to <TAB> before typing - or #., things tend to work out.

Ordered Lists

item 1
item 2
sub 1
sub 2
subsub 1
Unordered Lists

Start with -, +, or *.

hello
item 2
item 3
subitem 1
sub
subsub
Description Lists

Start with -, +, or * and followed by ::

Matlab is a funny language. 
 - Scope :: Scope doesn't work as expected, and messes everything up
   when loops mix variables up in recursive functions.
 - Namespaces :: You wish. 
 - Header Files :: Nope.
gives

Matlab is a funny language.

Scope
Scope doesn't work as expected, and messes everything up when loops mix variables up in recursive functions.
Namespaces
You wish.
Header Files
Nope.
Text Formatting
Individual words can be bolded with stars, italicized with forward slashes, and underlined with underscores. Also, there is verbatim and strike-through.

*bold* /italics/ _underline_ ~verbatim~ +strike-through+
Tables
Tables can be created from any line that starts with '|' (pipe). A line that starts with '|-' (pipe dash) is considered a horizontal seperator; <TAB> after inserting it to expand the separator.

this    is      a       sample  table
move    from    one     col     to
the     other   with    <TAB>   this column
Some tips:

<TAB> realigns the columns, and moves to the next column. If at end of line, it will create a new row.
C-c C-c will realign the columns without moving or creating new ones.
<RET> moves to the next row.
Table Formatting

When exporting, tables are drawn without cell borders or frames. Here are useful table formatting commands which you place immediately before a table.

This is a table with lines around and between cells
this    is      a       sample  table
move    from    one     col     to
the     other   with    <TAB>   this column
Literal Examples
Literal examples are snippets of text or source code that need to be unformatted on org export. Put this text between #+begin-example and +end_example.

Source Code

Org-mode is great for inserting snippets of code. This can be done with the

#+BEGIN_SRC [major-mode-name] [options]
#+END_SRC
[major-mode-name] adds a lot of extra functionality to these code blocks within your org file. It's also good for whoever is reading to know what the language is.

For example:

1:  int main() { 
2:  return 0; 
3:  }
Useful options and commands.

Options:

-n : add line numbers to the source code.
+n : add line numbers but continue from last SRC snippet.
-r : remove labels from source code
Commands:

C-c ['] : Allows you to edit the source code at point in its native mode. Opens a new buffer where you exit after editing by the command again.
C-c l : calls org-store-link when editing with ~C-c '~. This creates a label at the line currently being edited. It can be retrieved later with C-c C-l.
Easy templates

It gets tiring to use the long tags if you're doing this a lot. These are shortcuts to generate the above snippet borders. To insert, type a '<' followed by a template selector and then <TAB>.

Template selectors:

s    #+begin_src ... #+end_src 
e    #+begin_example ... #+end_example
q    #+begin_quote ... #+end_quote 
v    #+begin_verse ... #+end_verse 
c    #+begin_center ... #+end_center 
l    #+begin_latex ... #+end_latex 
L    #+latex: 
h    #+begin_html ... #+end_html 
H    #+html: 
a    #+begin_ascii ... #+end_ascii 
A    #+ascii: 
i    #+index: line 
I    #+include: line 
Linking
Linking files together

You can link files together with

[[file:filename][name-of-link]]
This will preserve links after export to HTML as well.

Linking sections within a document

You can create a link to a section within your document with the section name in brackets. The second option lets you call the link something else.

[[section-title]]
[[section-title][link-title]]
Exporting (C-c C-e)
You can export org files to any of the supported formats with C-c C-e [option].

C-c C-e will show you the options available in a separate buffer. Common ones are text, html, and latex. You can get PDFs by converting to latex, but you need to have a LaTeX environment installed on your system to use this.

Export Options (C-c C-e t)

When org files are exported, certain variables are set automatically but can be manually set by you. To change a variable's value, use

#+VARIABLE-NAME: value
anywhere in your document. At the top is probably best.

To paste a template of all export options in your org document so that you can set them immediately, use (org-insert-export-options-template), or C-c C-e t.

This will print

#+TITLE:       the title to be shown (default is the buffer name)
#+AUTHOR:      the author (default taken from user-full-name)
#+DATE:        a date, an Org timestamp120, or a format string for format-time-string
#+EMAIL:       his/her email address (default from user-mail-address)
#+DESCRIPTION: the page description, e.g. for the XHTML meta tag
#+KEYWORDS:    the page keywords, e.g. for the XHTML meta tag
#+LANGUAGE:    language for HTML, e.g. ‘en’ (org-export-default-language)
#+TEXT:        Some descriptive text to be inserted at the beginning.
#+TEXT:        Several lines may be given.
#+OPTIONS:     H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
#+BIND:        lisp-var lisp-val, e.g.: org-export-latex-low-levels itemize
               You need to confirm using these, or configure org-export-allow-BIND
#+LINK_UP:     the ``up'' link of an exported page
#+LINK_HOME:   the ``home'' link of an exported page
#+LATEX_HEADER: extra line(s) for the LaTeX header, like \usepackage{xyz}
#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS:   Tags that select a tree for export
#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS:  Tags that exclude a tree from export
#+XSLT:        the XSLT stylesheet used by DocBook exporter to generate FO file
within your document, but with your actual variable values instead of descriptions. Change any of the variables to the value of your choice. These descriptions are provided here for your reference.

The #+OPTIONS variable is very useful for specific tweaks and will effect both HTML and LaTeX exports.

H:         set the number of headline levels for export
num:       turn on/off section-numbers
toc:       turn on/off table of contents, or set level limit (integer)
\n:        turn on/off line-break-preservation (DOES NOT WORK)
@:         turn on/off quoted HTML tags
::         turn on/off fixed-width sections
|:         turn on/off tables
^:         turn on/off TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If
you write "^:{}", a_{b} will be interpreted, but
the simple a_b will be left as it is.
-:         turn on/off conversion of special strings.
f:         turn on/off footnotes like this[1].
todo:      turn on/off inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
tasks:     turn on/off inclusion of tasks (TODO items), can be nil to remove
all tasks, todo to remove DONE tasks, or list of kwds to keep
pri:       turn on/off priority cookies
tags:      turn on/off inclusion of tags, may also be not-in-toc
<:         turn on/off inclusion of any time/date stamps like DEADLINES
*:         turn on/off emphasized text (bold, italic, underlined)
TeX:       turn on/off simple TeX macros in plain text
LaTeX:     configure export of LaTeX fragments.  Default auto
skip:      turn on/off skipping the text before the first heading
author:    turn on/off inclusion of author name/email into exported file
email:     turn on/off inclusion of author email into exported file
creator:   turn on/off inclusion of creator info into exported file
timestamp: turn on/off inclusion creation time into exported file
d:         turn on/off inclusion of drawers
Variables are set with nil or t, and sometimes take an argument. For example

#+OPTIONS:     H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
Title

The title is taken from the first non-comment line in the file. If there is none, ie your file starts with a heading, it uses the filename. The title can be manually set using

#+TITLE: This is the title of the document
Table of Contents

Normally inserted after the first headline, you can set manually by inserting TABLE-OF-CONTENTS inside square-brackets ([]) seperately on a line.

Some useful options are:

#+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no TOC at all)
Including Other Files

You can include files in an org document, which will be rendered on export. This is done using the single line command

#+INCLUDE: "file-path" [type] [src-language]
type can be either (quote, example, or src). if type is src, then src-language can be any major-mode language.

HTML Export

Stylesheet

You can include a stylesheet by using

#+STYLE:    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../stylesheet.css" />
The styles used by org-mode to export specific parts of your document can be set in your stylesheet with the following variables:

p.author            author information, including email
p.date              publishing date
p.creator           creator info, about org mode version
.title              document title
.todo               TODO keywords, all not-done states
.done               the DONE keywords, all states that count as done
.WAITING            each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
.timestamp          timestamp
.timestamp-kwd      keyword associated with a timestamp, like SCHEDULED
.timestamp-wrapper  span around keyword plus timestamp
.tag                tag in a headline
._HOME              each tag uses itself as a class, "@" replaced by "_"
.target             target for links
.linenr             the line number in a code example
.code-highlighted   for highlighting referenced code lines
div.outline-N       div for outline level N (headline plus text))
div.outline-text-N  extra div for text at outline level N
.section-number-N   section number in headlines, different for each level
div.figure          how to format an inlined image
pre.src             formatted source code
pre.example         normal example
p.verse             verse paragraph
div.footnotes       footnote section headline
p.footnote          footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
.footref            a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
.footnum            footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)
Site Navigation

You can verily easily add "Up" and "Home" buttons on each page with

#+LINK_UP: 
#+LINK_HOME: index.html
Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are managed by links and automatically converted to their html counterparts. See Linking Files.

Publishing
Publishing is simply automating your export pipeline. When you have many files that require export, it is a good idea to create a publishing script for this.

Publishing Script

To enable project publishing with org-mode, create a local file in the project directory with the instructions. In our example we have named it org_publish.el.

(defconst home (file-name-directory (or load-file-name buffer-file-name)))

(require 'org-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      `(
        ;; add all the components here
        ;; *notes* - publishes org files to html
        ("main-page"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/")
         :base-extension "org"  ; Filename suffix without dot
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/")
         :recursive t           ; DONT include subdirectories
         :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
         :headline-levels 4             ; Just the default for this project.
         :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../css/stylesheet.css\" />"
         :auto-preamble t
         :auto-sitemap t                ; generate automagically
         :sitemap-sort-folders last
         :sitemap-title "Main Sitemap"
         )

        ;; The meeting notes to be published
        ("meeting-notes"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/meeting-notes/")
         :base-extension "org"
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/meeting-notes/")
         :recursive nil
         :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
         :headline-levels 4
         :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../css/stylesheet.css\" />"
         :auto-preamble t
         :auto-sitemap t
         :sitemap-title "Meeting Notes Directory"
         )

        ;; *static* - copies files to directories
        ("org-static"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/")
         :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/")
         :recursive t
         :publishing-function org-publish-attachment
         )

        ;; *publish* with M-x org-publish-project RET emacsclub RET
        ("emacsclub" :components ("main-page" "meeting-notes" "org-static"))
        ))

** [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Initial-visibility.html][Initial visibility - The Org Manual]] :website:
[2016-08-19 Fri 00:24] 
2.3.2 Initial visibility

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible1. This can be configured through the variable org-startup-folded, or on a per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything
#+END_EXAMPLE

The startup visibility options are ignored when the file is open for the first time during the agenda generation: if you want the agenda to honor the startup visibility, set org-agenda-inhibit-startup to nil.

Furthermore, any entries with a ‘VISIBILITY’ property (see Properties and columns) will get their visibility adapted accordingly. Allowed values for this property are folded, children, content, and all.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-u C-u <TAB>     (org-set-startup-visibility)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** [[http://orgmode.org/manual/org_002dcrypt_002eel.html][org-crypt.el - The Org Manual]] :website:
 [2016-08-25 Thu 23:19] 15.11 org-crypt.el

 Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or properties. Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and decrypt files.

 Any text below a headline that has a ‘:crypt:’ tag will be automatically be encrypted when the file is saved. If you want to use a different tag just customize the org-crypt-tag-matcher setting.

 To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your .emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (require 'org-crypt)
      (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
      (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))
     
      (setq org-crypt-key nil)
	;; GPG key to use for encryption
	;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.
     
      (setq auto-save-default nil)
	;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
	;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
	;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
	;; start Org.
     
	;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
	;;
	;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
#+END_EXAMPLE

Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted text being encrypted again.

 [2016-08-24 Wed 22:42] Reload Org

 As of Org version 6.23b (released Sunday Feb 22, 2009) there is a new function to reload org files.

 Normally you want to use the compiled files since they are faster. If you update your org files you can easily reload them with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 If you run into a bug and want to generate a useful backtrace you can reload the source files instead of the compiled files with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 C-u M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 and turn on the "Enter Debugger On Error" option. Redo the action that generates the error and cut and paste the resulting backtrace. To switch back to the compiled version just reload again with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

[2016-08-13 Sat 22:44] Blogging using org-mode (and nothing else)

As you can tell, the look of this website has changed significantly—and it was about time for that. In case you didn't know, this site used to be hosted on http://web.ics.purdue.edu/, which provides free webspace for Purdue students. I used to generate the static HTML pages from plaintext markdown files using the Python-based static site generator Pelican. It worked well for a while, but I ended up having a few issues with that setup:

The host was painstakingly slow to reach from anywhere but the Purdue networks
Pelican would just break sometimes, providing me with nothing but some cryptic Python exception messages
The website did not use TLS and loaded a lot of external content over an unencrypted HTTP connection, causing it to render incompletely when using HTTPS Everywhere
I prefer Org-mode over the fragmented Markdown syntax for writing plaintext documents
Source code blocks are prettier in Org-mode
So, of course, I looked for an alternative.

Since I was predisposed towards using Org-mode for this, Org's publishing feature was the first alternative I investigated. I don't have high demands—all I need is a lightweight, stable, static site generator. I don't need tag clouds, sophisticated pagination, theme support (I'm fine with hacking together my own CSS), or any kind of plugin support; all I really need is a small org-to-HTML converter that can be hacked using Elisp and that I can bolt the extras that I want onto. After browsing around a little bit, I found some neat examples here, here and here. These sites are exactly what I wanted—minimalist, simple, and based on pure Org.

Obviously, the Org publishing feature was all that I needed. I whipped up a nice little configuration that produces this website from a set of Org source files, some custom CSS and HTML, and some custom Elisp. This is what happens at a high level:

All of the blog's files sit in the ~/repos/blog directory and are version controlled using git
The custom Elisp sits in my emacs config. You can find a copy of the relevant sections below.
The source files can be roughly divided into the following categories:
/blog/—Each blog post is contained in an individual Org-file
/pages/—Static Pages, like the landing page, sit in their own directory as Org files
/res/—Contains custom CSS and the MathJax JavaScript
Org's publishing function org-publish uses magic (and some Lisp) to spit out simple, easy to read, and easy to render HTML from these sources (and a few others)
After the HTML files are generated, I'm using rsync to push them onto a Tec-X1 instance from bladetec, which runs nginx on Ubuntu 14.04 and costs a phenomenal €0.99 a month
Here's the obligatory screenshot of me editing this post in Emacs:


There are a few tricks involved in doing this—mostly concerning the generation of the sitemap—, but I will let the relevant section of my config speak for themselves, since they're pretty well commented (I think):

UPDATE <2016-02-02 Tue>:

I've received a few questions asking whether there exists an RSS feed for this blog. There wasn't until today, but I think this will work. I'm using ox-rss.el to generate XML from the blog's sitemap. I had to trick it into doing a few things like generating the correct pubdates and permalinks, but I think it works fine for what I need. The code below is the updated version, with RSS.

The publishing uses the Org HTML export backend a lot, so to start off, we require it here, along with the RSS publishing backend.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'ox-html)
(require 'ox-rss)
(setq org-export-html-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
(setq org-html-viewport nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next, we define some functions and variables that will be used by org-publish. First, let's define the website headers, footers, and make sure that the exported HTML points to the right style sheets.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq my-blog-extra-head
      (concat
       "<link rel='stylesheet' href='/../res/code.css' />\n"
       "<link rel='stylesheet' href='/../res/main.css' />"))

(setq my-blog-header-file "~/repos/blog/header.html")
(defun my-blog-header (arg)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents my-blog-header-file)
    (buffer-string)))

(setq my-blog-footer
      "<hr />\n
<p><span style=\"float: left;\"><a href= \"/blog.xml\">RSS</a></span>
License: <a href= \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p>\n
<p><a href= \"/contact.html\"> Contact</a></p>\n")
#+END_EXAMPLE

I'd also like to export drawers out to HTML; this idea is ripped directly from here.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(defun my-blog-org-export-format-drawer (name content)
  (concat "<div class=\"drawer " (downcase name) "\">\n"
    "<h6>" (capitalize name) "</h6>\n"
    content
    "\n</div>"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

MathJax usually recommends to use their CDN to load their JavaScript code, but I want to use a version that sits on my server.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq my-blog-local-mathjax
      '((path "/res/mj/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML")
        (scale "100") (align "center") (indent "2em") (tagside "right")
        (mathml nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now we'll get to some of the customizations I've bolted on Org's publishing features. In it's standard configuration, the sitemap generator produces a plain, kind of boring looking list of posts, which was inadequate for me. After hacking on the sitemap generation function for a little while, I came up with the following solution: When I write a blog post, I enclose the "preview" part of the post in #+BEGIN_PREVIEW...#+END_PREVIEW tags, which my (very simple) parser then inserts into the sitemap page.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(defun my-blog-get-preview (file)
  "The comments in FILE have to be on their own lines, prefereably before and after paragraphs."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((beg (+ 1 (re-search-forward "^#\\+BEGIN_PREVIEW$")))
          (end (progn (re-search-forward "^#\\+END_PREVIEW$")
                      (match-beginning 0))))
      (buffer-substring beg end))))

(defun my-blog-sitemap (project &optional sitemap-filename)
  "Generate the sitemap for my blog."
  (let* ((project-plist (cdr project))
         (dir (file-name-as-directory

         (exclude-regexp (plist-get project-plist :exclude))
         (files (nreverse

#+END_EXAMPLE

Next I define some pre-and postprocessors that run during the publishing process. They are used to move around some files before and after publishing.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(setq my-blog-emacs-config-name "emacsconfig.org")
(setq my-blog-process-emacs-config nil)

(defun my-blog-pages-preprocessor ()
  "Move a fresh version of the settings.org file to the pages directory."
  (when my-blog-process-emacs-config

                                               "settings.org")))
           (destdir (file-name-as-directory (plist-get project-plist :base-directory)))
           (cfg-file-dest (expand-file-name (concat destdir my-blog-emacs-config-name))))
      (copy-file cfg-file cfg-file-dest t))))

(defun my-blog-pages-postprocessor ()
  (message "In the pages postprocessor."))

(defun my-blog-articles-preprocessor ()
  (message "In the articles preprocessor."))

(defun my-blog-articles-postprocessor ()
  "Massage the sitemap file and move it up one directory.

relative link in the sitemap-publish function"
  (let* ((sitemap-fn (concat (file-name-sans-extension (plist-get project-plist :sitemap-filename)) ".html"))
         (sitemap-olddir (plist-get project-plist :publishing-directory))
         (sitemap-newdir (expand-file-name (concat (file-name-as-directory sitemap-olddir) "..")))
         (sitemap-oldfile (expand-file-name sitemap-fn sitemap-olddir))
         (sitemap-newfile (expand-file-name (concat (file-name-as-directory sitemap-newdir) sitemap-fn))))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert-file-contents sitemap-oldfile)
      ;; massage the sitemap if wanted

      ;; delete the old file and write the correct one
      (delete-file sitemap-oldfile)
      (write-file sitemap-newfile))))
The next preprocessor runs CSSTidy on the site's CSS.

(defun my-blog-minify-css ()
  (let* ((csstidy "csstidy")
         (csstidy-args " --template=highest --silent=true")
         (css-dir (expand-file-name (plist-get project-plist :publishing-directory)))
         (css-files (directory-files css-dir t "^.*\\.css$")))
    (dolist (file css-files)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert (shell-command-to-string (concat csstidy " " file csstidy-args)))
        (write-file file)))))

 [2016-08-30 Tue 00:19] 30.15 Updating the Dired Buffer

 This section describes commands to update the Dired buffer to reflect outside (non-Dired) changes in the directories and files, and to delete part of the Dired buffer.

 g
 Update the entire contents of the Dired buffer (revert-buffer).

 l
 Update the specified files (dired-do-redisplay). You specify the files for l in the same way as for file operations.

 k
 Delete the specified file lines—not the files, just the lines (dired-do-kill-lines).

 s
 Toggle between alphabetical order and date/time order (dired-sort-toggle-or-edit).

 C-u s switches RET
 Refresh the Dired buffer using switches as dired-listing-switches.

 Type g (revert-buffer) to update the contents of the Dired buffer, based on changes in the files and directories listed. This preserves all marks except for those on files that have vanished. Hidden subdirectories are updated but remain hidden.

 To update only some of the files, type l (dired-do-redisplay). Like the Dired file-operating commands, this command operates on the next n files (or previous -n files), or on the marked files if any, or on the current file. Updating the files means reading their current status, then updating their lines in the buffer to indicate that status.

 If you use l on a subdirectory header line, it updates the contents of the corresponding subdirectory.

 If you use C-x d or some other Dired command to visit a directory that is already being shown in a Dired buffer, Dired switches to that buffer but does not update it. If the buffer is not up-to-date, Dired displays a warning telling you to type g to update it. You can also tell Emacs to revert each Dired buffer automatically when you revisit it, by setting the variable dired-auto-revert-buffer to a non-nil value.

 To delete file lines from the buffer—without actually deleting the files—type k (dired-do-kill-lines). Like the file-operating commands, this command operates on the next n files, or on the marked files if any. However, it does not operate on the current file, since otherwise mistyping k could be annoying.

 If you use k to kill the line for a directory file which you had inserted in the Dired buffer as a subdirectory (see Subdirectories in Dired), it removes the subdirectory listing as well. Typing C-u k on the header line for a subdirectory also removes the subdirectory line from the Dired buffer.

 The g command brings back any individual lines that you have killed in this way, but not subdirectories—you must use i to reinsert a subdirectory.

 The files in a Dired buffers are normally listed in alphabetical order by file names. Alternatively Dired can sort them by date/time. The Dired command s (dired-sort-toggle-or-edit) switches between these two sorting modes. The mode line in a Dired buffer indicates which way it is currently sorted—by name, or by date.

 C-u s switches RET lets you specify a new value for dired-listing-switches.

 [2016-09-03 Sat 19:38] In this installation guide we’ll be using Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan. These instructions should work for older versions of OS X but they have not but tested.

 Install Xcode from the AppStore, this around a 4GB download.



 We’ll open up the Terminal which can be found at Applications/Utilities/Terminal. In the Terminal we can run the rest of our installation commands.



 We need to install “Command Line Tools” which gives us access to commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers such as make and GCC.

 xcode-select --install
 

 After that we need to agree to Xcode’s license. Either run the command below or open up Xcode which will prompt you to agree to the license.

 sudo xcodebuild -license
 OS X already has Ruby already installed but it has some quirks that makes installing Jekyll tricky. Instead of using this version, we’ll install our own version of Ruby.

 First we’ll install Homebrew. Homebrew helps you install packages and is a must-have for anyone programming on OS X.

 /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
 Now we can install Ruby.

 brew install ruby
 And now we can install Jekyll.

 sudo gem install jekyll
 We can test Jekyll is working by checking the version installed.

CONFIGURATION

The complete configuration including the appearance and shortcuts of the program are defined in a separate file named config.h. In this file you are able to change and adjust all the settings of zathura according to your wishes.

In addition you can create a zathurarc file (default path: ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc) to overwrite settings and keybindings by using the set and map function. For more information please check the faq on the website: http://pwmt.org/projects/zathura

 [2016-09-08 Thu 21:29] Try changing to ownership of the .plist file, as noted here.

 sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
 sudo chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
 It is also worth noting that these root LaunchDaemons can't be world writable, for security reasons:

 sudo chmod o-w /Library/LaunchDaemons/*
