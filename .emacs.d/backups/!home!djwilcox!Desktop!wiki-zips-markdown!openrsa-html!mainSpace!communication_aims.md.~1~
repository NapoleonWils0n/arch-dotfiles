Here’s a note for discussion that I did in helping prepare for the
workshop - David Wilcox\
\
I see these audiences/contributors before and after the event\
-   people attending
-   other staff and Fellows
-   people who are not Fellows but touch the RSA through events etc -
    potential Fellows
-   others interested in how membership organisations may become
    networked organisations. Roland Harwood’s piece on Network Value is
    relevent <http://snurl.com/ahnfm> and there’s the NCVO/RSA Future of
    membership project

\
Communication aims - for discussion\
-   help make the event as productive as possible by providing resources
    and opportunities for discussion beforehand
-   enable those not attending to contribute ideas, and hear what
    happened
-   help engage people with/on the new RSAN site, and any other social
    spaces that develop
-   share ideas, inspiration with the wider audience interested in RSA
    and networked organisations
-   demonstrate the potential for social reporting of other events

\
We’ve discussed a blog, Twitter feed, and space for online resources
before and after. To reach these audiences/users I suggest linked\
tracks\
\
1. RSAN site.\
\
2. Open site (s). The easiest option would be to use the OpenRSA blog
and wiki\
\
3. Twitter - could be through various accounts as well as openrsa. We’ll
need a tag.\
