# designing collaboration - Collaboration terms

The aim here is to develop a minimum set of terms useful in developing a
framework for describing collaboration. As such they are no much
definitions as a start on a working language for collaboration that
might be used across disciplines and sectors.\

### **Collaboration terms**
\
**Agenda:** the purpose, rewards and protocols favoured by one
individual or group of stakeholders. What they want, and how they aim to
achieve that.\
\
**Attitude**: whether or not people are disposed to be collaborative, in
the current context\
\
**Beneficiaries**: people whose need is being met. If they pay for that,
they are customers\
\
**Collaboration**: working together to a common purpose\
\
**Collaboration model**: a set of guidelines, and a process, indicating
how different stakeholders can collaborate within a framework of rewards
and protocols to some agreed purpose using a mix of methods.\
\
**Context** or situation: where we are collaborating, and what else is
happening there\
\
**Control**: the system by which permissions and rewards are given and
protocols enforced\
\
**Culture**: the shared mental code of “how we do things around here” in
an organisation or group, which may be expressed through protocols. May
or may not be collaborative.\
\
**Diversity**: how different are the people involved in the situation\
\
**Ecosystem**: stakeholders touched by the collaboration process and its
results\
\
**Engagement** is a necessary pre-condition to collaboration, if it
means opening up new ways of communicating, developing new relationships
and trust. However, collaboration requires a commitment from
power-holders to relinquish some control that goes beyond engagement.\
\
**Events**: when group interactions take place. These may be
time-limited activities face-to-face or online\
\
**Expectations**: what outcomes people hope for\
\
**Explicit**: being open about the purpose, control, and protocols
during a collaboration process is important to develop and maintain
trust\
\
**Facilitation**: assisting purposeful interactions during the
collaboration process, whether online or at face-to-face events\
\
**Forums**: where group interactions take place\
\
**Framework** for collaboration: a set of assumptions, concepts, values,
and practices for describing collaboration.\
\
**Group**: people interacting to some purpose, which may be short term\
\
**Ideas**: first thoughts on how to tackle a problem, meet a need\
\
**Intellectual property rights** determine who has control over whatever
is developed, and how people get rewarded.\
\
**Initiation**: how and why the collaboration started\
\
**Innovation**: a creative process to solve problems and meet needs, by
developing projects, products, services\
\
**Interaction**: people communicating and/or doing things together\
\
**Leadership**: who takes us forward, and in what style, e.g. may be
directive, facilitative\
\
**Method**: an activity performed by a group using a collaboration tool\
\
**Model**: a configuration of methods, processes, stances, protocols and
other elements of the collaboration framework designed to deliver an
agreed purpose\
\
**Motivation**: why we got involved\
\
**Network**: people with similar interests or concerns who interact\
\
**Online systems and tools** for collaboration: the means of
communicating and working together on the Internet towards some common
purpose.\
\
**Opportunity**: the perceived chance to solve a problem, develop a
project, product or service that meets the needs of beneficiaries.\
\
**Outcome**: the result of the process of collaboration, for
participants and beneficiaries. It may or may not be positive.\
\
**Ownership**: what you can control\
\
**People**: who is involved and what they are like\
\
**Process**: what happens over time. It may be formal/informal/playful,
planned/emergent, convergent/divergent\
\
**Projects**: products, services or other activities to meet the needs
of beneficiaries\
\
**Protocols**: the rules of behaviour, permissions and reward systems\
\
**Relationships**: who knows who, and how they deal with each other\
\
**Power**: power to is the ability to achieve purpose; power over is the
ability to enforce protocols, give or withhold permissions and rewards.\
\
**Purpose**: what we are trying to achieve - for example, projects,
products, services for specific beneficiaries; rewards for ourselves.\
\
**Return**: what you get out for what you put in\
\
**Rewards**: why we stay involved and motivated\
\
**Risk**: the likelihood things may not turn out as expected\
\
**Scale**: how many interests are involved, and how many there could be\
\
**Stakeholder**: a person, group or organisation who affect, or may be
affected by the collaboration process\
\
**Stance**: the degree of control a power-holder may cede - for example,
on a spectrum of tell, sell, consult, co-design, co-create (where only
the last two are collaborative)\
\
**Structure**: how connections are made, decisions taken, protocols
applied\
\
**Team**: a group working together over time to achieve a common
purpose\
\
**Tools**: means of enabling interactions, including events and online
systems\
\
**Trust**: people’s preparedness to rely on another’s communications as
truthful and actions as well-intentioned.
