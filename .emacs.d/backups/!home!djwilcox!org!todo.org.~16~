[2016-08-11 Thu 12:46] "I propose that German citizens who are fighting with terror militias in other countries, and take part in combat operations there, if they have a second nationality - and only then - they would lose German citizenship," he told a news conference.
"My proposals are limited to the points that can lead to more security rapidly," the minister said. "Other points will be discussed by the parties. We need a workable consensus in the coalition."
German media report that the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - coalition partners of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) - strongly oppose any general ban on dual citizenship. The Greens are also against the idea.
The security issue has become intensely political, as the country prepares for general elections next year and earlier regional elections.
