=Talking points for workshop discussion=

//The ideas below were developed in May 2012, since when the idea of
relaunching OpenRSA has been put on hold. On reflection, and from a wide
range of conversations, it may be more productive to focus development
of an innovation space to pilot ideas for the RSA we would like to see.
The next RSA. David Wilcox//

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \[\[Exploration|OpenRSA exploration\]\] will start with some talking
points aimed to frame discussion and lead up to \[\[Workshops|workshops
in autumn 2012\]\]. The key issue we are inviting people to engage with
is:

//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How can RSA Fellows
contribute to the organisation’s mission - and benefit from the
experience in ways that suit their needs as well?</span>//

That can be re-framed on a personal basis as: \* //<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">How
can being a Fellow of the RSA help me achieve more for myself and
others?</span>// \* //<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">What
changes would offer greater benefits to me and then to others?</span>//
==Provocations== The following are some first suggestions for opening
provocations and propositions, that can form the basis for talking
points. More \[\[Exploration|on the exploration page\]\] on how they fit
into the overall process.

**Open up on what’s happening** - Fellows aren’t clear on what
developments are currently planned.

**Clarify the terms of engagement, and expectations** - so that Fellows
know what to expect from their fees, and the nature of Fellowship.

**Allow self-interest**. Promote greater alignments between the RSA
programme and Fellows interests in learning, networking and their
careers.

**Encourage enterprise.** The social entrepreneurs network encourages
social enterprises to promote their activities. Allow businesses and
freelances with social objectives to do the same.

**Bring in business**. Encourage Fellows with commercial expertise and
contacts to bring that to bear in supporting the RSA’s mission.

**Think creative, collaborative and connected.** Fellowship council is
well established to provide representation of Fellows interests. We need
to strengthen ways in which Fellows can collaborate among themselves.

**Encourage Fellows to develop their own services**. The terms under
which Fellows make a donation limits the range of services RSA can
provide. Maybe Fellows can can do more for each other.

**Enable outside collaborations** - between Fellow-led initiatives and
others outside the organisation, as well as staff-led projects.

**Enable Fellows to meet more easily**. If that isn’t possible on RSA
premises, explore other opportunities.

**Develop online spaces and services** to meet this more open agenda
through co-design between staff and Fellows, or encouraging Fellow-led
initiatives.

**Favour the network, not the centre.** Aim to make it as easy to engage
outside London as in.
