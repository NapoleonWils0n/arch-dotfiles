## //The ideas below were developed in May 2012, since when the idea of relaunching OpenRSA has been put on hold. On reflection, and from a wide range of conversations, it may be more productive to focus development of an innovation space to pilot ideas for the RSA we would like to see. The next RSA. David Wilcox//

==Overall challenge and OpenRSA role== The overall challenge that
OpenRSA is addressing - in line with \[\[openrsa/about|our
objectives\]\] - is:

//How can RSA Fellows contribute to the organisation’s mission - and
benefit from the experience in ways that suit their needs as well?//

The Fellowship survey highlight networking as a high priority - so we
are working on the basis that our objective could be achieved in part by
helping Fellows develop personbal networking in a way that also builds
networks with RSA. See
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement/forum/topics/collaborating-towards-a-more-fully-networked-rsa|Collaborating
towards a more fully networked RSA.\]\]

We aim to explore that challenge on three fronts. How to: \# Help
Fellows understand what’s on offer from RSA, and the part that they can
play. \# Facilite more opportunities for collaboration between Fellows.
\# Connect Fellow-led initiatives with others outside the organisation.
==The workshop as part of an exploration== Here’s some ideas, based in
part on explorations I (David Wilcox) have been running with others
\[\[http://www.socialreporters.net/?page\_id=552|at
socialreporters.net\]\]

**Set up phase** \* Liaise with RSA staff and any relevant Fellowship
groups. \* Start our blog at OpenRSA.org, and report our activities
there and on \[\[http://rsafellowship.com/|RSAFellowship.com\]\] and the
Linkedin Group. \* Develop some questions and answers about Fellowship
to supplement \[\[RSA Fellowship|guidance already on offer\]\]. Dr Bob
Rollins
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/profiles/blogs/how-might-new-fellows-be-better-supported-when-they-first-join|has
made a start here\]\]. \* Report on any network development in prospect,
on the blog

**Developing workshop issues and ideas** \* Crowdsource some talking
points - \[\[Talking points|starters here\]\] - and initial ideas to
address the issues (the reason for the Talking Points - rather than
jumping straight to ideas - is that the issues are highly complex, and
we need to get some shared understanding of them.)

**At the workshop** \* Provide an update on the RSA context, from the
above work \* Use the talking points and initial ideas to generate and
prioritise more ideas \* Sort the ideas into those that can be taken
forward by Fellows on their own; those that can be achieve
collaboratively with staff; and those that can only by done by staff and
Board (thanks to the \[\[http://www.collaborate.so/games/|Social Spaces
Skills Game\]\] for this categorisation) \* Form groups around some
Fellow-led ideas

**After the workshop** This will depend on the pre-workshop and workshop
discussions, but we would expect to move forward with some practical
action on the Fellow-led ideas. ==Resources==
