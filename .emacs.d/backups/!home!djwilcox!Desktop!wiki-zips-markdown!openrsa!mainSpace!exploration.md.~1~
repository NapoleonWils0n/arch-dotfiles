//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The OpenRSA initiative was
started in 2007 to support new developments planned for the 250-year-old
\[\[http://www.thersa.org/|RSA\]\] - the Royal Society for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce. OpenRSA was particularly
active autumn 07- spring 08 around the launch of RSA Networks.

**Update: the latest discussion on exploring RSA networks development is
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement/forum|on the
RSAFellowship site here\]\].**

The following proposal may change during our planning and set-up phase -
but currently OpenRSA is conceived as an open collaborative exploration
over six months, starting in June 2012, around the theme:

//<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How can RSA Fellows
contribute to the organisation’s mission - and benefit from the
experience in ways that suit their needs as well?</span>//

The exploration will be conducted partly online, and also through
meetings and workshops.

==The background==

\[\[about|More here\]\] on the background to OpenRSA, and why the time
seems right. In particular,
\[\[http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/news/results-of-fellowship-survey|the
recent Fellowship survey\]\] led to recommendations including: \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">clearer
and more tailored paths to engagement for Fellows and improved online
offering</span> \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">increased
visibility of the RSA’s activities and realisation of its
mission;</span> \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">more
specific offerings for younger Fellows; and</span> \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">facilitation
for those who are willing to contribute to projects including funding
and to leave legacies to the RSA.</span>

<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">The
survey is being analysed in more detail, and there will be staff-led
proposals for development, including a new technology strategy. The
OpenRSA exploration is conceived as a Fellow-led initiative to
complement and support that work. We aim to work closely with staff
throughout.</span>

==<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">Why
engage with OpenRSA?</span>==

<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">The
OpenRSA exploration will only succeed if it engages the interest of a
range of Fellows, and so we are starting with \[\[Talking points|a
series of talking points\]\] to begin some conversations. The first of
these turns the theme of the exploration around to focus on the
personal:</span> \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">How
can being a Fellow of the RSA help me achieve more for myself and
others?</span> \* <span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">What
changes would offer greater benefits to me and then to others?</span>

<span
style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Liberation Sans',FreeSans,sans-serif;">We
are starting with these personal questions because one of the benefits
of RSA is the diversity of people involved, and their many interests.
Everyone has their own reason for being an FRSA. At the same time, there
is no clear statement of the purpose of Fellowship beyond that in the
\[\[http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/apply/uk|Fellowship Charter of
2010\]\] which says:</span>

“<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We form a unique combination
of committed people and diverse ways of working in our efforts to find
innovative practical solutions to pressing social problems" and “We
support each other by working collaboratively and creating an
enlightened space in which to tackle the challenges of the 21st
century”.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">It is unclear how far Fellows
may mix personal</span>interest with achieve an RSA vision. While the
bye-laws say FRSA may not be used for business purposes, some Fellows
use the Linkedin and RSAFellowship sites to promote their business
interests, and one of the strongest groups is for social entrepreneurs.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For that reason we have to
evolve some collaborative purpose from the many interests and
motivations of Fellows. One touchstone for success could be how far we
can re-engage Fellows who have left or dis-engaged, and how we can help
recuit more Fellows. We need to feel confident to answer the questions
from our friends:</span>

-   <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Why should I apply to join
    the RSA?</span>
-   <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">What does “FRSA” offer
    beyond the free events and activities run by the RSA - and beyond
    what I can get from my Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin
    connections?</span>
-   <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How might “FRSA” help me
    develop a project or other activities?</span>

==The exploration process==

The exploration is modelled partly on earlier OpenRSA work 2007-09, and
partly on explorations
\[\[http://www.socialreporters.net/?page\_id=552|undertaken by social
reporters here\]\]. First thoughts on the process also reflected
\[\[Workshops|in the workshops page\]\].

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Set up phase</span>** \*
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Liaise with RSA staff and any
relevant Fellowship groups, and recruit a core group.</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Start our blog at OpenRSA.org, and
report our activities there and on
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/|RSAFellowship.com\]\] and the Linkedin
Group.</span> \* <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Develop some
questions and answers about Fellowship to supplement \[\[openrsa/RSA
Fellowship|guidance already on offer\]\]. Dr Bob Rollins
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/profiles/blogs/how-might-new-fellows-be-better-supported-when-they-first-join|has
made a start here\]\].</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Report on any network development in
prospect, on the blog</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Developing workshop issues
and ideas</span>** \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Crowdsource some talking points -
\[\[openrsa/Talking points|starters here\]\] - and initial ideas to
address the issues (the reason for the Talking Points - rather than
jumping straight to ideas - is that the issues are highly complex, and
we need to get some shared understanding of them.)</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Plan workshops based on the talking
points and ideas</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">At the workshop</span>** \*
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Provide an update on the RSA
context, from the above work</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Use the talking points and initial
ideas to generate and prioritise more ideas</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Sort the ideas into those that can be
taken forward by Fellows on their own; those that can be achieve
collaboratively with staff; and those that can only by done by staff and
Board (thanks to the \[\[http://www.collaborate.so/games/|Social Spaces
Skills Game\]\] for this categorisation)</span> \* <span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">Form groups around some Fellow-led
ideas</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">After the workshop</span>**
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This will depend on the
pre-workshop and workshop discussions, but we would expect to move
forward with some practical action on the Fellow-led ideas.</span>
