*We’ll be discussing the programme in detail online - [links
here](Joining%20in%20the%20discussion.html){.wiki_link}.*\
\
*The workshop is especially about getting input from the participants,
rather than just delivering a set of presentations. However, of course,
the discussion needs to be put in some kind of context, so we have an
information-giving part as well. Ideas about the future of the RSA
Fellowship are not already fixed and are up for discussion!*\
\
**BEFORE THE WORKSHOP: Participants are asked to bring along an object
(or objects) which represent, metaphorically, what the network of RSA
Fellows means to you. You can interpret this and vary it as you wish,
e.g. perhaps bring an object that represents what you think it currently
is, and another that represents what it could be.**\
\
OUTLINE OF THE WORKSHOP:\
\
13.30 – 14.00 Arrival; coffee/tea\
\
14.00 – 14.30 Introduction From Laura Bunt and Laura Billings, RSA: How
the workshop came to be organised, and how the RSA is changing. What the
Fellowship is, and also what tools are available to Fellows, both inside
and outside the RSA. What is the power of the RSA; why is the RSA
different from other networks? How projects, events and online spaces
are currently developed.\
\
14.30 – 14.45 Malcolm Forbes on the Open RSA Facebook group, and
subsequent OpenRSA wiki, distilling the ideas on the RSA/civic
innovation/networking which have come via the discussions there.\
\
14.45 – 15.40 Hands-on workshop part 1 - building a vision for the
fellowship\
\
15.40 – 15.55 Break for coffee/tea\
\
15.55 – 16.35 Hands-on workshop part 2 - developing projects and spaces
