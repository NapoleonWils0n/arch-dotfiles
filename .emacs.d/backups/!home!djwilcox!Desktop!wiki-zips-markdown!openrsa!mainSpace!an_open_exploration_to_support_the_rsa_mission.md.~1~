**Summary**: relaunch \[\[openrsa/Exploration|our earlier OpenRSA
exploration\]\], which was originally framed as “//How can RSA Fellows
contribute to the organisation’s mission - and benefit from the
experience in ways that suit their needs as well?”.//

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">We can now draw on inspiration from
recent blog posts by Matthew Taylor; the work of the new Board in
refining the RSA mission; and the start of scoping of new online
platforms. Recent discussions on Linkedin about RSA mission and
Fellowship show the scope for engaging a wide range of Fellows. Here’s a
suggestion for the focus, and some draft provocations:</span>

**How can we use open processes and digital technology to support the
RSA mission: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">encouraging arts,
manufacturing and commerce, and enhancing human capability.</span>**

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Take a whole organisation approach - involve Fellows, staff, Board, Council and others who engage with RSA</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Adopt whole system thinking - draw on ideas of collaborative economy and social ecology</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Build on RSA strengths - staff-led projects and events, diverse Fellowship, many partners, wider audience</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Reconnect to RSA foundations - develop virtual coffee houses for conversations across disciplines and sectors</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Help people use digital technologies to develop the ecology bottom up - foster personal learning networks</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Blend online and face-to-face - expand events digitally, enable informal meetings</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Offer rewards to match individual interests - personal or professional development, projects opportunities, sociability</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Use the process to build the Fellowship - renewal, recruitment, and returning Fellows</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Recognise the skills and resources needed for the process - develop a communication and innovation hub</span>

# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Make it fun</span>

The exploration would be a first stage in development. It would not aim
to take on the major task of developing and transforming Fellowship -
that is a matter for RSA Board, staff and Fellowship Council. It could,
however, make a modest contribution to the design of the process needed.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The exploration could be valuable to
other membership organisations considering how social media and and
other developments can either enhance their offerings - or challenge
their sustainability as people develop their own networks more easily.

==Matthew Taylor’s challenge== In a series of blog posts about RSA
mission and Fellowship chief executive Matthew Taylor set a major
challenge: how to achieve more through the activities of Fellows, and
wider relationships, in pursuit of the historic mission to encourage
arts, manufacturing and commerce, and in the current context to develop
human capability supporting social progress. \* <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/thersa/from-good-to-great/|From
good to great?\]\]</span> \* <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/uncategorized/mission-and-myth/|Mission
and myth\]\]</span> \* <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/thersa/fellowship-waiting-for-the-great-leap-forward/|Fellowship
- waiting for the great leap forward\]\]</span> \* <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://www.matthewtaylorsblog.com/thersa/capable-of-anything/|Capable
of anything?\]\]</span>

The challenge comes at a time of major innovation for the RSA. The new
chair Vikki Heywood and Board of trustees are refining how the broad
mission can be turned into a fresh round of projects and programmes;
regions are developing teams to support local action; the technology
board are scoping new online systems for Fellows and the organisation as
a whole.

In his post Matthew indicated that progress will require more than just
“try harder”. He wrote: “… these posts are about how the RSA moves from
good to great and, as I have said throughout, I think this depends most
on taking the mission of Fellowship engagement to the next level and
doing it in the next couple of years.”We will know we have together
achieved something really significant when: \* Projects begun by Fellows
and led by Fellows are starting to become as high profile and
influential as the research and development projects managed by
professional staff and, as a sign of this, Fellows’ projects are
starting to access external funds. \* Research among FRSA is showing a
high and rising awareness of all aspects of the Society’s work and how
Fellows can get involved. \* More Fellows are being recruited (and
retained) because they see the RSA, and the Fellowship in particular as
a powerful vehicle for innovation and social progress. At present the
numbers are pretty steady (which is a good outcome in the current
economic environment), but a gradually rising roll will make it possible
for us to continue to invest more in Fellowship. \* And, most of all,
outside the RSA there is a growing sense that the Fellowship is made up
of people with the inclination and the tools to intervene when new
solutions are needed."

==What Fellows think== Fellows have already turned their attention to
the challenge with two major discussions in the Linkedin group. \* Item
for the RSA Board awayday: a mission we can understand<span

style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://bit.ly/ZD29nM|Summary of
discussion\]\]</span>//<span style="line-height: 1.5;">-</span>//<span
style="line-height: 1.5;"> 26 Fellows, over 150 comments</span> \*
Here’s CEO Matthew Taylor’s vision for FRSAs. What’s yours? <span
class="s5" style="line-height: 1.5;">\[\[http://bit.ly/143Mr3H|Summary
of discussion\]\]</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">and the
following key points. 15 Fellows, over 70 comments</span>

Key points from the Linkedin discussion about Fellowship: \* there is a
lot of enthusiasm for developing more Fellow-led projects and activities
to contribute to the RSA’s overall purpose, as Matthew Taylor hoped for
in his post \* however, rather than just identifying specific
tip-of-the-iceburg projects as contributing to the purpose, we should
take account of the overall contribution that the work of Fellows can
make where that has been supported by networking within RSA and other
support \* in order to achieve that greater contribution, we need much
better networking and support. This may be some sort of communication
and innovation hub, plus well-facilitated online and offline spaces,
specifically to serve Fellows \* while the RSA has overall to pursue the
charitable objects defined in its Charter, the notion of constraining
Fellows’ individual activities as charitable does not make sense, and is
not motivating \* in order to retain, motivate and recruit Fellows we
need a way of blending the achievement of some overall purpose with
personal and professional development and learning … in ways that are
relevant to the individual.

==Draw on lessons from RSA networks and the past five years== How can we
take discussion and then action to “the next level” as Matthew suggests?
My suggestion is that we first pick up points where his posts, and
Fellows’ discussions, would appear to connect: make the Fellowship a
vehicle for innovation and social progress; access external funds;
involve Fellows in the work of staff-led projects; blend overall purpose
with individual opportunities for personal and professional development.
In short, enhance the capability of Fellows and others associated with
the RSA to achieve its mission.

Back in 2007, shortly after Matthew became chief executive, the
NESTA-funded RSA Networks projects aimed to do something similar, and
many lessons were learned. They included Start with relationships, not
transactions; Be clear about the invitation; Follow exciting leads;
Understand an online presence as integral to the mission; Let networked
innovation models change the hierarchy. All lessons are
\[\[openrsa/Principles for networked innovation|summarised here\]\]:

Perhaps in 2007 too much emphasis was placed on the potential of online
systems that had not been properly developed or supported, and too
little on the need to enable change throughout the organisation. The
current round of developments offers a fresh opportunity.

What came through strongly from the RSA Networks experiment - and
experience over the next five years - is that what’s needed is a shared
and more open process of exploration and development. As the evaluation
report said: **Co-design change to ensure relentless focus on the
experience of participants.**

During the RSA Networks initiative a group of Fellows
\[\[openrsa/OpenRSA 1 archive|formed OpenRSA\]\] as a group to offer
support, through workshops and online networking. Since then the
Fellow-led RSA
\[\[http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement|digital engagement
group\]\] has done an enormous amount to help shape RSA technology
development, provide practical support, and has become the liveliest
public space for discussing RSA innovation.

During 2012 a group of Fellows involved in RSAde
\[\[openrsa/Exploration|began a fresh OpenRSA exploration\]\], but
paused pending clarification on RSA mission and technology. <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Now is a good time to restart.</span>

==Restarting the exploration== A promising model for exploration that we
can use is one \[\[http://socialreporters.net/?page\_id=552|developed by
socialreporters.net\]\] for work during 2011-2012 with Big Lottery Fund
and Nominet Trust. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">That drew on a couple
of earlier projects undertaken in part by RSA
Fellows:</span>\[\[http://www.innovationexchange.net/|the idea of an
open innovation exchange\]\]<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> in 2007 and
the \[\[http://www.commonspace.org.uk/|membership project\]\] 2008-09 to
explore the impact of social media on membership organisation - later
carried on by RSA and NCVO.</span>

The Nominet Trust explorations in 2012 were aimed at exploring how
digital technologies could be used by young people, and also those later
in life, and are informing what projects and funding might be most
appropriate. The proposed RSA exploration could make a contribution to
the development Matthew Taylor hopes to see in Fellowship.

Socialreporters went about the explorations by developing a set of
provocations, based on initial research, and then evolving more detailed
ideas through a mix of online discussion and workshops. The advantage of
this approach is: \* The initial provocations provide a good focus for
conversations \* Any ideas for action are rooted in a review of research
and past experience \* Ideas are developed and evolved openly, so
everyone involved feels some ownership \* The process helps develop the
relationships and networks needed to take things forward

==The new exploration== As explained above, the new exploration follows
earlier thinking about RSA networks, the work of the RSA digital
engagement group, and more recent online discussions. It could be framed
as:

**How can we use open processes and digital technology to support the
RSA mission: encouraging arts, manufacturing and commerce, and enhancing
human capability.**

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">These might be a set of opening
provocations:</span> \# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Take a whole
organisation approach - involve Fellows, staff, Board, Council and
others who engage with RSA</span> \# <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Adopt whole system thinking - draw on ideas of
collaborative economy and social ecology</span> \# <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Build on RSA strengths - staff-led projects
and events, diverse Fellowship, many partners, wider audience</span> \#
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Reconnect to RSA foundations - develop
virtual coffee houses for conversations across disciplines and
sectors</span> \# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Help people use
digital technologies to develop the ecology bottom up - foster personal
learning networks</span> \# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Blend online
and face-to-face - expand events digitally, enable informal
meetings</span> \# <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Offer rewards to
match individual interests - personal or professional development,
projects opportunities, sociability</span> \# <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Use the process to build the Fellowship -
renewal, recruitment, and returning Fellows</span> \# <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Recognise the skills and resources needed for
the process - develop a communication and innovation hub</span> \# <span
style="line-height: 1.5;">Make it fun</span>

The exploration would be a first stage in development. It would not aim
to take on the major task of developing and transforming Fellowship -
that is a matter for RSA Board, staff and Fellowship Council. It could,
however, make a contribution to the design of the process needed.

==What next?== This page offers some ideas for discussion with other
Fellows in the digital engagement group, and those who have taken part
in the Linkedin discussions. We can then try and engage the interest of
the RSA Board and, of course, Matthew Taylor.

There’s a discussion about the earlier exploration, with this update,
