# designing collaboration - RSA next steps

### Elements of a model for next steps development of RSA networks

\
Reflecting on the [RSA Networks experience](RSA%20themes.md), and what might be needed for
next steps:\
\
### Preconditions

*If taking a planned approach …*\
\
**An agreed purpose** that motivates people to get started and defines
what we are trying to achieve (in the case of the RSA, is it civic
innovation projects, or more general networking among Fellows that may
or may not be related to civic innovation)\
\
**Clear ownership**. In the case of RSA, does this lie with staff (the
current position), with Fellows (implied on the new online system “This
is your community and we are hoping that it becomes a self-governing
site.”) or jointly. Governance and management arrangement, and
intellectual property rights, should reflect ownership.\
\
**Facilitative leadership** to establish or negotiate the levels of
control different interests may have, the protocols of behaviour, and to
manage the overall development process (can this be undertaken by RSA
staff, by Fellows, or a mixed group?). Leadership will be closely
related to ownership.\
\
**Communications online and face to face** through a range of methods
appropriate to the purpose (could include events, informal
get-togethers, use of the existing online system, and/or other online
tools)\
\
**Evaluation and feedback**. Ways of deciding priorities among projects,
judging how far the programme is succeeding, learning along the way.
(This might be done by independent assesment, or collaboratively in a
central forum).\
\
**Rewards**. Benefits for the key interests, both in terms of
transactions and outcomes. (this would depend on the purpose, and would
be negotiated with those involved).\
\
### In practice

I’m doubtful whether it would be possible to negotiate all these complex
issues within the structure and culture of the RSA at present. I think
that in this case Paul Birch and Paul Miller’s message that [innovation is really difficult](http://www.commonspace.org.uk/blog/david-wilcox/are-big-innovations-possible-within-nonprofits)
within existing organisations rings true. However, to be positive, [I’ve suggested in this blog post](http://socialreporter.com/?p=328) how RSA might both develop an internal system and collaborate with others on web-enabled social innovation.\
\
**Update**\
There’s been a lively discussion on the [OpenRSA Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/openrsa/topics),
including a suggestion that a group of Fellows might keep the older
Drupal-based networks site running as a testbed for evolving ideas,
topics and projects with those people keen to experiment … a sort of
innovation community within a wider community for all Fellows.
