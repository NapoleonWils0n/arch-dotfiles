Our first meeting will be at the RSA in John Adam Street, from 12 noon -
5pm in the Tavern Room on Monday October 1 . There’s room for about 50
people, and to attend you need to [register here on
Eventbrite](http://www.openrsa.eventbrite.com/){.wiki_link_ext}. That’s
even if you signed up on Facebook, so we have confirmed numbers.\
**Cost**: we’ll be asking for a contribution of £15 on the day. RSA are
subsidising but we need to cover some of the room hire, and tea\
**Lunch**: sandwiches from 12 noon, thanks to the RSA\

\
**Summary**\
The aim of the event is to explore our experience of the RSA so far, and
the potential for networking and creating projectsin order to make a
practical contribution to [Matthew Taylor’s
vision](Matthew%20Taylor%27s%20vision.html){.wiki_link} for the RSA as a
“network for civic innovation”. One idea is to use some of the event to
simulate development of the sort of projects that Matthew and Fellows
might hope to see develop.\
\
**The idea of the event**\
Currently Open RSA has some 300 members in Facebook, with a mix of
Fellows and others just interested in the future of RSA. Facebook is
proving a good way to get people together - but not to discuss or do
anything. The general feeling among those contributing to the group is
that we want to make a positive contribution to RSA development, while
also making new friends and getting insights into the role of social
media in organisations and networks. There’s acknowledgement that this
involves a mix of online and face-to-face. The October 1 event is a way
of getting started, and feeding directly into the 360 programme. See
[About OpenRSA.](about.html){.wiki_link}\
\
**Context**\
The RSA is planning a 360 event on November 22 to involve Fellows in
development of Matthew Taylor’s vision for the RSA as a “network for
civic innovation”. They will appoint staff within the next few months to
work on the programme, which will have local projects at its core.

other Fellows, and any examples of seeding projects or participating in
projects locally/nationally. If new Fellow, or not yet joined, what
would you hope for in finding connections/contributing to projects? What
have you found particularly useful in making these connections
productive? (20 minutes)\
\
Feedback from each table on main themes from discussions – not a formal
presentation, but more facilitated conversation across tables in plenary
– ‘what did we talk about and how does that connect to what you talked
about?’\
\
**1.30 Creating networks in RSA – reflections on the Facebook experiment
and the relationship between offline/online networking**\
\

vision as a network for civic innovation. We will mix up the tables so

invitation to consider what technology would support the social model
envisaged in this scenario.\
