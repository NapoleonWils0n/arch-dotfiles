The RSA Fellowship is changing. Over the past two years, the RSA has
been working with Fellows to galvanise the collective capacity of the
Fellowship and develop online and offline networks to support civic
innovation. We’ve learnt a great deal and made some real progress; RSA
Fellowship has a new strategic direction and fresh energy in its efforts
to support and engage its membership.\
\
We’d like to invite you to a creative, practical workshop to share ideas
about how Fellows can connect with each other, develop projects, and
work towards our shared ambitions. For more information and to register
for the event please see the invitation here:\

\
Please note that space is limited to 30 to ensure a hands-on atmosphere
– we’d encourage you to book early. And please share ideas before and
after the event via the RSA Networks Platform.\
\
We look forward to welcoming you.\
\
With best wishes,\
