Part of the evaluation by NESTA - who funded development of RSA networks
- involved video interviews and clips from events, and they’ve been
promising for a while that these would go up online. [Their
site](http://www.nesta.org.uk/rsa-networks/){.wiki_link_ext} gives an
interview with chief executive Matthew Taylor as a taster.\

[RSA - A new vision for the
RSA](http://vimeo.com/2737270){.wiki_link_ext} from [NESTA
Connect](http://vimeo.com/user1120423){.wiki_link_ext} on
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com){.wiki_link_ext}.\
\
Towards the end of the interview Matthew likens the RSA to a kind if
civic RAC, where you might find some experts prepared to help you out
with a problem.\
-   One of the ways in which I characterised the RSA … the model I had
    at the very beginning … was I wanted us to be the RAC of
    civic activism.
-   When you needed a group of people, people like us, reasonably high
    powered people from different kind of of backgrounds, quite self
    confident people, with a set of skills, - and you needed a group of
    people to come together to solve a problem - ring the RSA.
-   Wherever they are, they are that kind of people and they have got
    that kind of network. That is ultimately my aspiration.

You can also hear what Matthew said at an OpenRSA event in October 2007

On the [NESTA vimeo
account](http://www.vimeo.com/user1120423){.wiki_link_ext} you can now
find more videos, including this interesting explanation from Laura Bunt
- who leads on RSA networks development - about how things were planned
internally among department. Laura and Laura Billings from the
Fellowship department will be giving us an update at the workshop on
Thursday.\
I’ll be taking a camera, and hoping we can get a progress update on
video. Written reports are fine, but I think that the videos by Eleanor
Ford and Simone Jaeger give a far better idea of the vision and
challenges of the past eighteen months.\

As an experiment, I’ve set up a
[forum](http://openrsa.uservoice.com/){.wiki_link_ext} at to see if it
can help us prioritise what we do next as the loose OpenRSA collective.\
\
I’ve seeded it with some ideas taken from [the reports of the 19th
February
session](http://openrsa.wikispaces.com/Workshop+reports){.wiki_link} at
and a couple of others have already chipped in too.\
\
Please take a look, see if there are new ideas you’d like to add, and/or
spread your 10 votes across those that have been posted.\
\
Comments and/or criticism of this approach are welcome, as always.\
