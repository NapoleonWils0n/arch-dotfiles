*On October 30 2007 I got this unexpected email*\
\
Hi David,\
\
As you may know we regularly profile one Wikispace as “Space of the
Month” in our email update to our members. We think the\
[https://openrsa.wikispaces.com/](home.html){.wiki_link} space would be
a good choice as our\
October 2007 space of the month. Your space seems to be valuable for all
those who are considering how to build and strengthen their community in
the digital world, and we’d love to share your story.\
\
If you’re interested we will write a little blurb and point people
toward your Wikispace but we also like to have the community hear from
you. Please send me just a couple of short sentences in answer to each
of these three questions:\
\
Our Space: (What your space is for)\
\
Our Community: (Who is involved in the space including usernames if you\
like)\
\
Our Experience with Wikispaces: (Your experiences with Wikispaces and\
anything you’d like to highlight about the site.)\
\
Look forward to hearing from you.\

**Our space**\
\
OpenRSA is an experiment in using a wikispace, events, and other social
software to help a 250-year-old UK membership organisation re-invent
itself by becoming more networky and less hierarchical. The organisation
<http://www.thersa.org/> - Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures & Commerce - started in the coffee houses of Covent Garden,
so we are just introducing new tools for conversation with a wider
reach.\
\
**Our Community**\
OpenRSA started as a Facebook group - now with 340 members - after a
get-together of about 15 people. We set up the wikispace to give us
additional functionality for our larger meeting on October 1. Anyone can
get involved in OpenRSA who is currently a Fellow of the RSA (and there
are 27,000 of those worldwide) or interested in becoming a Fellow.
There’s an official RSA Networks blog here
<http://mtblog.typepad.com/rsa_networks/>. OpenRSA aims to be a friendly
unofficial complement run by volunteers.\
\
**Our experience with Wikispaces**\
Wikispaces was an easy choice because of past experience, ease of use,
and functionality. Participants in events can add their reports, we can
our embed video, and also take in a feed from the chief executive of the
RSA, Matthew Taylor. We’ll be doing more prior to an official RSA event
for 250 Fellows on November 22.\
