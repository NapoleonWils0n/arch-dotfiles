# designing collaboration - Common themes

[RSA Networks](RSA.md) and [Social Innovation Camp](Social%20innovation%20Camp.md) are very different
programmes - but both were funded by NESTA to explore collaborative
innovation, so I think it is fair to drawn some comparisons. Their very
difference may also offer some insights.\
RSA Networks was conceived as a programme to produce social/civic
innovation projects from within an organisation … and has run into
difficulties because of the problems of achieving that within a
traditional hierarchical structure. NESTA invested £100,000.\
Social Innovation Camp was developed by social entrepreneurs who believe
that social innovation may not be possible with traditional institutions
- and the web enables individuals to by-pass them and use networks to
create their own projects. SI Camp, while modest, has created enormous
enthusiasm and some projects that continue to develop. NESTA invested
£25,000\

### Summary of the programmes

\
**Summary of RSA Networks**\
In autumn 2007 [Matthew Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Taylor_%28Labour_politician%29),
the new chief executive of the 250-year-old RSA, launched a progamme
called [RSA Networks](http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/rsa-networks)
under which the 26,000 members (called Fellows) would become more
central to the work of the organisation. They would have have greater
opportunities to network among themselves, contribute to long-standing
programmes of research and development, and also become an
outward-facing network for civic innovation. “Thought leadership” would
no longer be confined to the high profile contributors to RSA events and
publications. Action for social good would no longer be limited by staff
resources and partnerships. The RSA would become a new-style think tank
and incubator of social innovation.\
The programme was launched through a highly-successful [open space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)
event for 250 Fellows in November 2007, and supported by an online
platform for communication and collaboration. Hundreds of Fellows
subsequently participated online, and generated scores of project ideas.
Staff were trained as facilitators. The programme was supported by an
investment of £100,000 from the Government-backed innovation
organisation [NESTA](http://www.nesta.org.uk/).\
However, as an interim evaluation report subsequently showed, it proved
difficult to realise a vision that required change on so many fronts at
once. After one year few of the projects have any clear outcomes,
discussions online have died away, and a robust version of the online
system is still some way off.\
While online interactions have been problematic, it was clear Fellows
were keen to meet, and a range of London and regional events have been
highly successful. It seems likely that these have helped build some
networks, and perhaps some projects - but it is difficult to know
without some better central communication system.\
In addition, the programme provides many lessons for programmes
attempting collaborative innovation using a mix of online and offline
methods, harnessing skills and commitment across different disciplines.\
Staff and Fellows are meeting on how to take advantage of lessons
learned for next stage development, with new senior staff appointments
in place.\

\
**Summary of Social Innovation Camp**\
A group of three social entrepreneurs, disatisfied with the ability of
conventional charities to use new technologies for social innovation,
secured funding from [NESTA](http://www.nesta.org.uk/)
for a Social Innovation Camp over a weekend in London in April 2008. The
aim was to bring together those who were working at the sharp end of
social problems with web designers and developers who could help create
solutions.\
Their call for ideas produced 77 project proposals, which the
organisation cut back to 20 for submission to an advisory group. From
these six projects were chosen.\
Over the weekend some 80 people worked together to produce prototypes,
which were presented at a Show and Tell session. One winner and one
runner up were given prizes of £3000 and £2000. An additional project
was developed during the weekend, and accepted as part of the process.\
The weekend, and the overall process, produced enormous energy and
connections going beyond the two days. In September four of the seven
projects were still under development.\
NESTA is funding a further SI Camp in December 2008. The organisers have
[set out their thinking](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157) about
web-enabled social innovation, and put out a [call for ideas](http://www.sicamp.org/?p=193).\

### Themes and lessons

\
**Purpose**.\
**RSA Networks:** There were at least three agendas in play and three
different sets of potential beneficiaries in RSA Networks:\
1. Civic innovation. Developing projects that could fulfill the
aspirations of RSA Fellows who would lead them, and also others
“outside” who would benefit. This agenda was set by Matthew Taylor.\
2. Fellowship networking. Enabling Fellows to make more connections with
others, for whatever purpose. Fellows would be the main direct
beneficiaries. The attraction of networking among Fellows could also be
used for marketing and recruitment.\
3. Lessons from the programme, to share with others. NESTA’s agenda\
\
1. might lead to 2. but probably only for a limited number of Fellows.
Similarly 2. might assist 1. but would not achieve it on its own. 3.
requires commitment from RSA and Fellows, and an appropriate mechanism.
The additional, overarching agenda - again Matthew Taylor’s - was to
re-invent the organisation through a combination of 1. and 2. This
perhaps make it difficult to unravel the two and get an agreed focus.\
\
**SI Camp:** The goal for everyone was very clear throughout the
process: work together to develop web-enabled solutions to social
problems that you have defined. The organisers were also clear about
[their philosophy](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157)
of the way that social technology can help people create big changes
from small beginnings.\
\
**Control**.\
**RSA Networks:** Collaboration is only possible where the key
participants - stakeholders - have some equality of power. It may be
important that they shape the overall process, rather than participating
in a framework set by one power-holder. This is difficult for any
hierarchical organisation. RSA faced a double challenge on this front.
First, they needed to involve Fellows in the design of the programme if
it were to be - as they hoped “their” community and market place.
Secondly, staff beyond RSA Networks staff needed to see Fellows as
equals in any work they did together. While there were a lot of early
statements about co-design and co-creation, RSA senior staff resisted
any attempts to formalise these in clear arrangements for shared
control. This reflects a classic problem in many engagement processes -
failing to define stance explicity on the spectrum from tell, sell,
consult through to co-design or co-create. The rhetoric was at the
co-design and co-create end … but the practice was around sell and
occasionally consult.\
\
**SI Camp:** While the SI Camp organisers created a strong framework and
process, they left people to organise themselves into teams, and were
prepared to allow an additional project to develop during the weekend.
They planned carefully, then left things open and flexible.\
\
**Ownership**\
**RSA Networks:**Ownership is clearly related to control. Whose
programme is this? The help file on the latest version of the RSA
Networks site says: “This is your community and we are hoping that it
becomes a self-governing site” However, all decisions about the site are
taken by RSA staff, usually without consultation.\
\
**SI Camp:** There was no attempt by organisers to claim ownership of
ideas or the model. After the event they encouraged people to take the
SI Camp model and [apply it elsewhere](http://www.sicamp.org/?p=152).  
The ethos of the event generated by the organisers encouraged everyone to share their
ideas.\
\
**Attitude**.\
**RSA Networks:** Collaboration only works if participants want to join
in. At the RSA Fellows did, but from the interim evaluation it sounds as
if many of the staff outside the RSA Networks team were, perhaps
understandably, less keen. Fellows had nothing to lose, but staff would
be taking a risk in moving out of established ways of doing things. This
would be difficult unless they were given strong assurances and support
from the top.\
\
**SI Camp:** Everyone turned up with a shared expectation of
collaboration, and the format of the event reinforced that. Sociability
helped.\
\
**Communication**.\
**RSA Networks:** There was no consistent communication of plans and
decisions to Fellows. Staff resisted requests for a central forum for
discussion of the programme (again a control issue). A group of Fellows
committed to the vision of RSA Networks, but sceptical about
implementation, set up OpenRSA to provide a complementary convening
place online and off. This was accepted by RSA, but the group lost
motivation during the programme. In retrospect, this was probably partly
due to the lack of responsiveness of staff, the difficulty of
maintaining volunteer input, and ambiguity about control and leadership
of the programme.\
\
**SI Camp:** The [blog](http://www.sicamp.org/) kept
people up date before, at and after the event, and participants were
able to communicate through
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sicamp) and a
[Backnetwork](http://sicamp.backnetwork.com/) online
system (inivitation only). This worked well because most people were
confident online - and also meeting face-to-face.\
\
**Leadership**.\
**RSA Networks:** Collaboration requires facilitative leadership and
consistent guidance through the process. Matthew Taylor provided a
powerful vision at the start, but according to the interim report, could
not subsequently spend much time on the programme. The initial programme
leader had to do the work in addition to her normal duties as director
of marketing and communications. There were no clear reporting and
decision-making procedures for staff working on the programme. New
senior staff appointments now offer the chance for a fresh start, and a
clear statement of what stance the RSA staff will take to staff:
consultees or co-creators.\
\
**SI Camp:** The SI Camp organisers created the vision, raised funding,
set the terms of engagement, and the process to select projects. They
then moved into a more facilitative mode of working and created the
self-organising space within which people could develop their projects.\
\
**Motivation**.\
**RSA Networks:** Programmes powered by volunteers - as RSA Networks is
meant to be - will only work if the volunteers continue to feel
motivated. This generally involves feeling valued, knowing what is going
on, having some say in what is planned, having fun. One problem for RSA
Networks is that RSA traditionally has not managed volunteers, and isn’t
quite sure what “Fellows” are.\
\
**SI Camp:** While the prizes were small - £3000 and £2000 for winner
and runner-up - people appeared motivated by the chance to work
collaboratively in a friendly, fun atmosphere to create some innovative
projects.\
\
**Online system**.\
**RSA Networks:** From the outset the programme relied on an online
system as the main forum for interaction. This system also provided the
way to evolve and model the type of exchanges and processes that would,
it was hoped, lead to civic innovation projects. However, against all
conventional wisdom, no-one with experience of online systems was
appointed to manage the system, or to mentor and support Fellows and
staff. Very few people within RSA had any experience in depth of online
systems and social media. This meant that not only did the RSA not know
what it was doing, it didn’t know what it didn’t know. The external
consultants appointed to develop the system were very active, but could
not, from their position, embed learning within the organisation. They
also left part way through the programme as the RSA decided to
re-establish the online system using different consultants and software,
within a complete rebuild of the RSA website. This was substantially
delayed, and the new RSA Networks site is still not in operation.\
It could be said that RSA fell into the classic [technology trap](http://partnerships.typepad.com/civic/2004/09/technology_trap.md)
- believing technology would produce innovation and collaboration, while
not blending in other collaborative approaches. If the technology is
delayed, or does not work well, it becomes the scapegoat for other
failings.\
\
**SI Camp:** There was no purpose-built online system: the organisers
used Wordpress, Backnetwork and Twitter. This meant that costs were low
and there was no substantial lead-in time.\
\
**Project development.**\
**RSA Networks:**One aim of RSA Networks was to produce innovative
projects for external, social benefit. However, there was no clear
process for mentoring or otherwise supporting project, or choosing those
which might get some resources. The expectation appeared to be that
Fellows would work this out for themselves. This was unrealistic when
those involved were all volunteers, generally with busy personal and
professional lives to lead.\
\
**SI Camp:** The process for gathering ideas, choosing and then
developing projects during the weekend succeeded in producing seven
strong projects. However, the critieria by which projects were chosen
were not particularly clear, and there was relatively little support
after the Camp for projects. It may be that the second phase of
development from October 2008 - with monthly meetups around the December
event - provides the opportunity to build networks of support and
generally keep the buzz going.\
\
**Networks and teams**.\
**RSA Networks:**The twin agendas of innovative project development, and
internal networking, led to a confusion of terminology and model. Much
emphasis was placed on the development of “Fellow networks” - which are
fine for social and other networking. However, innovative projects
require project teams, and where people have never worked together, come
from different disciplines, and are volunteers, a good deal of team
development and support is needed. This did not appear to be
recognised.\
\
**SI Camp:** SI Camp has the potential to develop networks of people
interested in web-enabled social innovation, while recognising the need
for more tightly-formed teams to develop projects.\
\
**Events**.\
**RSA Networks:**While online interaction has been problematic, one of
the most successful elements of the programme has been events: first the
initial open space event on November 22 2007, then the events to evolve
the online system, followed by further networking and project
development exchanges. There are now regional facilitators, and they are
making great efforts to promote more local networking.\
In London, one of the frequently heard requests from Fellows was more
space at RSA headquarters to meet informally with others. This is
currently limited to the bar.\
\
**SI Camp:** The next phase of SI Camp development recogises the need
for people to continue to meet to maintain momentum. While the projects
are web-enabled, the process is substantially face-to-face.\
\
**Diversity**.\
**RSA Networks:**One of the great strengths of RSA is the diverse nature
of its membership, and the wide range of programmes and events. RSA
Networks has the potential to realise the inherent collective
intelligence of the Fellows, particularly if this were linked to the
highly successful events progamme that attracts an even wider range of
non-members. Some of the potential became evident at the November 22
event, and through early activity on the online system. However, because
people are making new connections outside their normal networks,
facilitation becomes particularly important, and this hasn’t been
evident in later stages of RSA Networks.\
\
**SI Camp:** While there was a fair spread of interests at SI Camp, most
of those attending were young, tech-savvy people. The next phase offers
the opportunity to recruit more widely - but will this make it more
difficult to get the rapid bonding of interests? Is a wider spread of
interests and backgrounds important if the SI Camp model is to make a
major impact on social problems?\
\
**Trust**.\
**RSA Networks:**It is generally recognised that collaboration requires
development of trust between collaborators. With good, trusting
relationships there is a lot of give and take if things go wrong. It has
been difficult to establish trust between staff and Fellows in such an
uncertain situation.\
\
**SI Camp:** The open, participative nature of the process appeared to
create the conditions within which people were prepared readily to share
their ideas.\
\
**Overall collaboration model.**\
**RSA Networks:**Because there were so many different agendas and
potential beneficiaries, with no clear process to agree outcomes, it is
difficult to discern any specific model. One metaphor used was
marketplace of ideas - but that only works if there is some currency of
exchange or motivation. In retrospect is easy to say there should have
been a clearer agreed purpose, process and criteria for evaluation.
However, it might be useful to reflect how realistic it is to expect to
develop collaboration models for social benefit, that are as clear cut
as business models (see for example [Business Models on the Web](http://digitalenterprise.org/models/models.md)).
In a business context, everyone knows they are there to get some
financial return on investment, and there are clear contractual
protocols. Where the aim is a social/civic project, with contributions
from different sources working to different motivations, there are far
more parameters, and it is more difficult to evolve a model.\
\
**SI Camp:** The [Big Idea](http://www.sicamp.org/?page_id=157) behind Social
Innovation Camp is that web technologies enable people to develop
innovative projects outside traditional institutions. They can build
networks with others and “this allows an individual to affect change by
themselves on a scale that previously would have been difficult to
achieve.” SI Camp piloted an accelerated face-to-face demonstration of
how this can produce a lot of ideas and some developed projects. The
monthly meetups and a further camp may begin to show how far the
approach can scale up, particularly if others take up the invitation to
“steal” the idea and run their own camps.
