### []()Using Twitter {#toc0}

\
Twitter is a simple, free tool that allows you to send and receive short
messages - like mobile texts - to and from individuals and networks of
people. You can do it from your phone or computer.\
\
We’ll be experimenting with Twitter as one of the tools that OpenRSA can
use related to events and general RSA developments.\
\
If you are new to Twitter, here’s a video explaining how it works.\

-   Go to <http://twitter.com/> and sign up. It’s really simple.
-   Start following people. That means going to their home page on
    Twitter and clicking follow when you are logged in to Twitter. Some
    names below. First one to follow is
    [http://twitter.com/OpenRSA](http://twitter.com/openrsa){.wiki_link_ext}
-   Check back on your home page to see messages - or even better
    download a desktop client like
    [Thwirl](http://blog.twhirl.org/){.wiki_link_ext}
    [Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/){.wiki_link_ext} or
    [Twibble](http://www.twibble.de/){.wiki_link_ext} (Windows or Mac)
    [Twitterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific){.wiki_link_ext} (Mac).
    You can then view your messages like this

\
![twitter.jpg](/mainSpace/files/twitter.jpg "twitter.jpg")\
![thwirl.jpg](/mainSpace/files/thwirl.jpg "thwirl.jpg")\
-   Just type you message, hit return, and it will go to anyone
    following you. If you want to alert someone in particular add @ - so
    to alert the openrsa account do @openrsa. If you want to send a
    direct, private message use d openrsa and the message. More [here
