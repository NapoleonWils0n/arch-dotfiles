When you fill the box with your address and send, you will get an email
with a link to confirm you wish to subscribe to the group. Click that
and you are subscribed for emails to and from the group. You can stop
there.\
However, there’s an additional step if you want to use the group through
the web interface. Google says this:\

The “join” option allows you to decide how frequently and in what form
you have emails.\
“Sign in” gives you full access to web features of the group - however
you must either use an existing Google account details to sign in (if
you have an account), or create a Google account. Any problems email me
