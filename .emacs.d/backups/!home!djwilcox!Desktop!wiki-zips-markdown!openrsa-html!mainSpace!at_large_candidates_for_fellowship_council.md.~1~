I am standing for election to Fellowship Council as an ‘At Large’ member
of the team.\
What will I bring to the Council?\
I work in audience development, identifying the barriers that prevent
people from becoming involved in organisations and then creating ways to
break down those barriers. I spend time clearly demonstrating what an
organisation has to offer, in ways that enthuse and motivate people. So,
on a daily basis I deal with the sort of challenges that face the RSA
and its Fellows at present.\
A Londoner born and bred, I have lived and worked around the country for
the CBI, Bath and Southampton Universities and various heritage
organisations and museums. I currently work in Sheffield and live in the
Peak District, crossing over the RSA Regional boundaries! I am Regional
Secretary for RSA Yorkshire. I am also co-founder and organiser of the
successful and productive Sheffield RSA Network, which we set up when a
number of Fellows became frustrated with the lack of local RSA activity
and the subsequent waste of the ability, creativity, expertise and
insight of the local Fellows.\
Our greatest strength is our Fellows, but there are barriers to these
Fellows being fully involved in the potential work of the RSA – poor
internal communication channels; lack of a clear public image; regional
isolation. These are issues that Fellowship Council needs to focus on
and which, given the opportunity, I will address.\

<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">Hello
All, It’s interesting seeing the discussion(s) develop, tho’ as an
averagely-digitally aware person I’m already getting to the stage wher
I’m not sure which discussion I’m on! So, I’ll go back to what I said to
David when he first contacted me about expanding Fellowship Council
Hustings to online - I have reservations about the online approach to
the Hustings because although we can put huge amounts of energy into
setting up the online groups and entering discussions, the vast majority
of Fellows will never know about it. There is still nothing on the RSA
website Home page about the elections - that is the first point of call
for most people who have a fairly basic digital awareness - which is
probably the level that the majority of our Fellows have (any research
been done by JAS on this - how our Fellows relate to the centre?). So, I
want to work on the central end of the election information. I will be
in contact with Michael Ambjorn again early next week to look at getting
Election info on the Home page of the RSA website and links to the
Fellowship discussion sites - if no-one knows, no-one will discuss! So,
that’s where I’ll currently put my time.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">My
contribution to the list of what the candidates agree on is a question -
do we agree that central RSA has too great an emphasis on the all
important task of bringing in new Fellows to the detriment of retention
and ‘servicing’ of current Fellows. I believe their balance is wrong and
in fact is causing Fellows to leave the RSA when renewal time comes
around.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">In
answer to Andy’s question about RSA supporting individual Fellow’s
projects: currently, the RSA scene is one of exciting innovation - but
the RSA needs to clarify what its aims are, so that what and who is
supported and encouraged and taken ‘national’ etc is measured against
agreed RSA criteria for broad social development. It all goes back to
effective committee organisation and discussion. Let’s get some good
structural organisers on Fellowship Council which will enable all the IT
and communication ideas to flow. Cheers, Jenny</span>\

The power of the internet has been a key aspect in growing my business.
Everything from online communities, LinkedIn, blogging, Skype (and
others) have always played an important part in the way my team works
and we always look out for innovative uses of the next technology.\
I’d like to play a more active role in the RSA and the Fellowship
Council feels like a natural step forward. My goal is to use the skills
I have developed in growing my companies to drive online collaboration,
communication and resources within Yorkshire.\
If we want a more joined-up RSA it has to be led by the Fellows and
using online tools and new technologies is a crucial aspect in
accelerating that process.\
I have been an active member of the Digital Engagement Group for the
past 2 years and am the Yorkshire Digital Champion as well as a
Yorkshire Committee member. I am the former West Yorkshire Chair of the
Institute of Directors and a board member at Yorkshire Dance. If you’d
like a more engaged, better connected RSA Fellowship, please vote for
me.\

agree with Andy that taking the council to the next phase should be all
of our focus. We need to get more engaged with our fellows and get them
collaborating and connecting. Using the online platforms like this is
essential for that.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">The
wealth of knowledge, experience and ideas within the fellowship is
astounding, and working with the team at John Adam Street we need to tap
into that to make a social impact in the areas where fellows live. We
need to create more of a community and network out in the
regions.</span>\

\
As an ‘At Large’ Councillor I will contribute both a range of
experiences and specific expertise in social enterprise and impact
measurement. I also offer a deep passion, evidenced in practice, for
creating positive social value for individuals, communities and the
environment.\
I currently work across three main roles: as founder and director of
Intentionality CIC, as SocialEnterprise Development Manager for The
Salvation Army (UK) and as Director of Development for the Social
Business Partnership. I have worked for organisations in the private and
voluntary sectors, in the UK and overseas. These varied roles mean I
offer a perspective encompassing big, small, new, old, social and
corporate, and yet all with the themes of enterprise and impact at their
heart.\
In balancing multiple roles, I can think on my feet and as a Councillor
I will ask challenging questions and can be relied upon to implement
actions. I like to apply research to practical, complex, impactful
situations and would add to debate in the Council and its working
groups. My experience in impact measurement means that I will put into
practice the maxim ‘you measure what is important’ and use the findings
to drive improvements and enthusiastic involvement in the RSA.\
I actively participate in the RSA social entrepreneurs’ network and am
an ardent supporter of the Spotlight and Catalyst programmes. I have
already given time to training and advising various Catalyst winners and
am keen to get more involved. As a Councillor, I will ensure that the
projects have ‘a tangible and positive social impact’ and contribute to
getting the ‘biggest bang for the buck’ of the Catalyst fund.\
Above all, I look forward to being part of a more enlightened, more
sustainable, more impactful organisation that is working to create a
better world.\

the others who have already commented below, I’m an ‘At Large’ candidate
and won’t repeat my candidate statement here. There are certainly some
common themes among the candidates - taking the Council forward,
developing new ideas, encouraging engagement of and collaboration
between Fellows - that I wholeheartedly support. More specifically to my
nomination, I’m particularly interested in social enterprise, social
impact and the Catalyst Programme.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">In
looking through the findings of the recent Fellowship Survey, there were
three recommendations that particularly caught my eye and which resonate
strongly with what I’d like to be involved in, support and encourage as
part of the Fellowship Council:</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">17)
Increase visibility of realisation of the RSA’s mission and continuously
demonstrate how the RSA is delivering value to Society as a
whole</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">18)
Define structure of key metrics for future performance monitoring and
benchmarking</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">19)
Further analysis of the qualitative data collected as part of this
survey is likely to provide additional insights into the expectations of
fellows in the under-40’s group and those employed in the Third
Sector</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">Above
all (and perhaps most appropriately for this stage of the election
process given that many will have already voted and/or not all
candidates will want to or be able to engage with this online
discussion) I’m keen that I, and hopefully my fellow candidates, listen
and learn as much as possible to the Fellowship. I’m hoping that this
forum and others will provide a space not only for us to tell you about
ourselves, but for you to tell us about what you want from and hope for
the RSA in the 21st century.</span>\

\
I am Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of East Anglia.
Following experience as a teacher I developed an academic career as an
applied educational and social researcher, specialising in the
evaluation of educational innovations and the collaborative construction
of actionable knowledge with educational practitioners. In both respects
I attracted national and international recognition.\
In 2009 I was elected by RSA Fellows in the Eastern Region to the new
Fellowship Council. As such I participated in restructuring the
governance of the Society to give Fellows greater influence in its
affairs. The positive impact of this democratic restructuring is clearly
evident.\
On the Fellowship Council I held the brief for education and embarked on
convening a problem- focussed multi-disciplinary Fellows Education Forum
as a pilot in the Norwich area. This Forum now consists of a stable
self-sustaining network of Fellows engaged in an action research
process, aimed at giving parents and young people in educationally and
socially disadvantaged communities a voice in articulating and sharing
their educational stories and experiences to each other, ultimately
empowering them to develop community based action strategies to effect
change in the life chances of young people. This is being done in
partnership with a community radio station. The aim has always been to
roll out such problem-focussed and Fellows-led Forums across the
regions.\
There remains much to be done in finding ways to roll out Fellow-led
local projects nationally and internationally to establish them as a
basis for information exchange and thematic networking; also, in
establishing stronger linkages between the RSA’s funded projects and
Fellow-led initiatives and thematic networks. My experience and skills
as an applied social researcher and member of the Fellowship Council to
date has equipped me to play a leading role in these major areas of
development.\

<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I
am in agreement with Andy Gibson as my candidate statement will show.
There is an urgent need to create strong links between RSA projects and
Fellows with relevant expertise. There is also an urgent need to
stimulate the formation of Fellow initiated action research projects
aimed at understanding and finding innovatory solutions to what Andy
refers to as ‘entrenched social problems’. In Norwich we have
established an interdisciplinary RSA Fellows Forum, which has focussed
on the complex relationship between community factors and educational
outcomes in schools. The forum has been sustained. For two years, and I
am anxious to explore how we can roll out similar local forums
nationally and link central RSA projects with them to mutual
benefit.</span>\

I believe I can bring to the RSA a deep practical understanding of the
power of digital technologies, genuine passion for the ideas and
creativity of the Fellowship, and a commitment to the vision of the
Society to use arts, manufacturing and commerce to improve our society.\
My involvement with the RSA began in 2007 and in the five years since
then, I have become increasingly involved in the work of the Society.\
I have served on the Fellowship Council since its inception in 2009,
helping to give shape and identity to this important body in its early
years. I have continued to champion a strong focus on Fellowship
activity in the Council, and to connect the work of the Society to the
broader interests of the Fellowship that sustains it.\
I continue to be involved in a number of other initiatives alongside my
work on the Council. As a judge for the Royal Designers for Industry I
have helped align the criteria for the award to the social objectives of
the RSA, and on the House Development Committee I have contributed my
knowledge of digital and participatory technologies to help make John
Adam Street a world-class centre for events and innovation.\
In my professional career I have focussed on social enterprise and
impact. I co-founded the social education start-up School of Everything
(www.schoolofeverything.com) in 2006, and co-wrote Social by Social
(www.socialbysocial.com) in 2009, one of the first practical guides to
using social media tools for social impact. My main focus now is
Mindapples (www.mindapples.org), a non-profit organisation which asks
“What’s the 5-a-day for your mind?”.\
I have also written for the RSA Journal, and am a recipient of a
Catalyst Award for my new project to build digital tools to organise and
manage volunteering, Do a Bit.\

<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I
won’t restate too much of my candidate statement here (plus I really
can’t bear too much shameless electioneering!) so the main thing I
thought I’d say to kick things off is that my focus has previously been
around promoting opportunities for Fellows to connect with each other,
which I still believe in strongly.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">Where
I intend to focus in this next phase of our growth as a Council is in
creating opportunities for Fellows to contribute to the work of the
Society, and supporting Fellows voices in the wider debate about what
the UK and our global society needs to thrive and survive.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I
see the RSA as a community of people from diverse backgrounds and
disciplines, coming together to research and pilot innovative new
solutions to entrenched social issues. The work of the staff and
Projects Team is pioneering in this field, and many Fellows are also
leading the way in these activities. Excellent projects like RSA
Catalyst are already starting to support Fellows to turn their ideas
into action, and I want to help create even more paths for Fellows’
ideas to be showcased and supported by the RSA, for mutual
benefit.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I
think the RSA is on its way to being the best institution in the UK for
supporting people with ambitious ideas for social impact, and I hope to
help it get there. Hopefully many Fellows will agree!</span>\

My career has been in education, in schools and colleges across the UK.\
A Churchill Fellowship (1997) allowed me to set up an online schools’
network across Europe. For six years we monitored butterflies, as
indicators of climate change. Survey data was posted on our award
winning, EU funded, website “The Butterfly Sight”. This partnership led
to my PhD research (Exeter) on “Motivation and collaborative learning
online”. A series of peer-reviewed papers on eLearning followed and I
presented at a number of international conferences. I was elected to
Fellowship of the Linnean Society.\
I joined the eLearning team at the National College for School
Leadership, (2003) using my expertise to create web-based mentor and
facilitator courses. I also facilitated online consultations between
school leaders, departmental policy teams and education ministers. My
experience would be useful to the RSA Digital Engagement Group and to
the council’s work in enabling Fellows to collaborate online.\
Currently I am evaluating ‘web seminar’ use in International
Baccalaureate courses. Baccalaureate curricula resonate with those of
the RSA ‘opening minds’ project - I hope to contribute to this.\
As chair of the Welsh Association of Churchill Fellows I was asked by
the RSA and the Churchill Trust to set up a joint ‘advising’ project.
New Churchill Fellows are offered the chance to link with a FRSA who is
willing to act as an advisor. Fellows who took part in this year’s pilot
will present their outcomes at the RSA autumn conference in Wales. I am
delighted to be a member of the new RSA Wales Cymru team organising this
event.\
Help from the RSA Skills Bank group has been essential for the success
of this pilot. Together we are drawing together ‘lessons learned’ for an
expansion of the advising project across the UK.\

are all very important aims and I totally agree with them. I have been
thinking about what could be put in place in order to achieve them. I
have some ideas that I would like to discuss. I would really welcome the
chance to develop them with you, as I believe passionately in
collaborative learning.</span>\

I began my professional life working for James Caan in the early 90s,
headhunting Intellectual Property Lawyers into city law firms.\
Following an ‘epiphany’ – having logged onto the internet for the first
time in 1995 – I joined one of the UK’s first ‘dot com’ enterprises
‘Taps.com’ – the UK’s first employment website. Within 3 years Taps.com
became one of the UK’s fastest growing, profitable ‘dot.com’ enterprises
at the time of my exit in 1998.\
Upon exiting, I set up www.Jobsgopublic.com, the first online employment
network to focus on the Public and Third Sector, which still retains its
position as a market leader, with over 1.4 million visitors each month.\
In 2008, I was invited to become a Trustee of www.Unltd.org – The
Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs. Together with colleagues at Unltd,
we now manage a £100+ million endowment, which has funded over ten
thousand social enterprises since inception. I also mentor various
social entrepreneurs and am on the advisory panel of the Emerge Venture
Lab (www.theemergelab.org).\
I am now working on my latest venture ‘GoodPeople’: a technology
platform and services business that aims to tackle the social challenges
we face by connecting the supply and demand for talent, arguably our
most valuable natural resource. By assisting ‘information flows’ between
the private sector employees and their counterparts in socially-focussed
organisations, we believe profound change can happen. Quickly.\
I am passionate about harnessing the latent skills that exist within our
society, and feel that the RSA should be doing more to harness the
latent potential of the fellowship, in order to scale social innovation
and build capacity into Civil Society organisations. To assist this
journey, I will bring 17 years worth of expertise, strategy,
communications, talent management and technology.\

I joined the RSA 5 years ago (at the age of 25), since when I have
enjoyed the rich variety of networks, activities, and talks on offer.
I’m a Civil Servant and social entrepreneur, with a career spanning a
number of Government Departments, most recently the Treasury. Outside my
‘day job’, my belief in the power of individuals pulling together for
social good led me to set up WeDidThis.org. uk, a ‘crowdfunding’ website
pulling lots of small donations together to support the UK arts sector.
Prior to merging with PeopleFund.It in March, we funded nearly 50 arts
projects through thousands donations, supporting projects across
artforms and regions, from local arts festivals to saving two community
galleries threatened with closure.\
My vision is of a more engaged Fellowship base, better placed to
collectively make sense of and influence our rapidly changing world. I
have experience of making big organisations work – as well as hands-on
experience of tackling some of the biggest public policy challenges
facing the UK – combined with a self-starting drive to get things done.
As I described in my recent RSA Comment blog, I would particularly like
to bring together the digital engagement and Catalyst strands to even
better unlock the talents and capacity of our Fellowship base. I am
passionate about broadening the RSA’s Fellowship base and improving our
offer to new Fellows, while also recognising the depth of wisdom, energy
and enthusiasm that is already well evidenced across the Fellowship. I
believe that the RSA can be a great example of what a group of
switched-on individuals can do to build a better society – and I want to
help make this happen.\
I’ll be starting a conversation shortly about the RSA and social change
on my blog – do join me at <http://edwhiting.wordpress.com/>\

all- firstly, thanks David and Jemima, and hello Charlotte (both of whom
are brilliant and have my votes). I’m an at large candidate and also
have added a bit to my statement in a blog <span
style="color: #438293; text-decoration: none;">[here](http://edwhiting.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/the-rsa-awakening-the-sleeping-fellowship-giant/){.wiki_link_ext}</span>.
Do have a look- comments v welcome indeed.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I
love the RSA, and have hugely enjoyed being involved with it. It feels
like we’ve now taken the first steps to making the Fellowship really
fuel new ideas and thinking (at a time when we desperately need both),
and I’m v keen to help step this up a notch. I’ve set out some ideas in
my blog- in short, I think we could go even further to clarify the
Fellowship offer, segment the Fellowship base a bit more and then help
Fellows to discover projects and discussions that make things happen.
All the pieces are there, and are gradually (and courageously) being
brought together- I want to be part of making this happen even
faster.</span>\
<span
style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; display: block; font-family: Arial,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;">I’ll
stop now, but let’s get talking some more.</span>\

\
I am the Founder and Director of the Small Enterprise Research Unit
(SERU) at Newcastle University Business School. Since joining Newcastle
University in 1983, I have been principal investigator of numerous
Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and European funded action
and policy oriented research projects.\
My internationally recognised research and publications revolve around
key themes, including, entrepreneurship, public policy, and science,
innovation and technology. I established the ESRC funded ‘Role Model
Platform for Innovative Women’ in the North East in 2007. I was an
elected Board Director and Trustee of the ‘Institute for Small Business
and Entrepreneurship’ (2005-2011, maximum length).\
I held the elected Chair of the Diversity Consultative Group, Newcastle
University (2009-2012) and, as such, have significant knowledge of equal
opportunities policies. I am a member of the ‘Judging Panel’, of Formula
One (F1) in Schools Technology Challenge. To this end, I run annual
events, ‘Role Model Platform for Young Scientists’, in collaboration
with key employers, F1 and STEM outreach representatives, sponsored by
the ESRC’s Festival of Social Science, aimed at sparking greater
interests in science, technology, design, engineering and
entrepreneurship amongst young people.\
I firmly believe my international/national/local networks and
collaboration together with my expertise and skills provide me with a
unique opportunity to promote greater participation of Fellows in RSA’s
local/national projects and networks, in the areas of enterprise,
manufacturing and education in particular and the RSA’s wider remits as
a whole.\
If elected to Fellowship Council, I will strive to make positive
contributions to the Council’s overall aim of ensuring an effective and
sustainable working relationship between the RSA, its Fellows and wider
communities and to assist RSA to identify innovative ways to promote
greater diversity and inclusion through the removal of stereotype that
exists in our society.
