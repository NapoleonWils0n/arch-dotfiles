### []()How did RSA networks start? {#toc0}

In February 2007 Matthew Taylor, the new chief executive of the
[RSA,](http://www.thersa.org/){.wiki_link_ext} [emailed Fellows with a
vision](Matthew%20Taylor%27s%20vision.html){.wiki_link} that “the RSA
becomes a network for civic innovation, empowering both Fellows and
staff to develop new initiatives that promote and deliver progress in
society”. On November 22 2007 the RSA hosted an event where some 250
Fellows developed ideas on how to put this vision into practice -

During 2008 the RSA developed the network online and through
face-to-face events.\

### []()What is OpenRSA? {#toc1}

OpenRSA was started as an online network, with occasional events, by a
group of Fellows and others interested in supporting bottom-up
development of RSA networks. The “open” tag emphasised people’s interest
in ensuring that the civic innovation processes engaged people outside
RSA Fellowship, as well as Fellows.\

## []()The February 19 2009 workshop {#toc2}

[Details here](February%202009%20workshop.html){.wiki_link}\
\
**How did the workshop come about?**\
Following discussion online two Fellows, Lizzie Jackson and David
Gauntlett, offered to host a half-day event at the University of
Westminster to explore further development of RSA networks. RSA staff
agreed to participate, in order to provide context and sum up
discussions. [Invitation and programme
here](February%202009%20workshop.html){.wiki_link}.\
\
**Who is designing and managing the day?**\
RSA sent out the invitations, David Gauntlett and Lizzie Jackson are
hosting and facilitating discussion.\
\
**What is the purpose of the day?**\
To provide an update on RSA networks development (from RSA staff), and
explore further development during interactive sessions facilitated by
David Gauntlett, who is Professor of Media and Communications at the
School of Media, Arts and Design, University of Westminster. [More here
about David’s work.](http://theory.org.uk/david/){.wiki_link_ext}\
\
**Who can attend?**\
Since the main focus is the development of network for RSA Fellows, the
30 invitations are limited to RSA Fellows, staff and NESTA, who funded
the development programme.\
\
**Is there any pre-workshop discussion online?**\
There has been some discussion on the OpenRSA Google group, which you
can [see and join
here](Joining%20in%20the%20discussion.html){.wiki_link}. There is also a
discussion area on the RSA networks site
[here](http://www.thersa.org/networksplatform/projects/open-rsa-connect,-create,-innovate/_nocache){.wiki_link_ext}
(Fellows only, login required).\
\
**Can people who are not attending the workshop contribute to
discussion?**\
Anyone is welcome to discuss RSA networks and project development in the
online spaces (as above), and those participating in the workshop are
encouraged to reflect this discussion on the day. However, the focus of
the interactive sessions on the day will be hands-on 3D model building …
so direct inputs from outside the workshop are difficult to
accommodate.\
\
**What happens after the workshop?**\
We hope participants will report of the day online, with continuing
discussion on RSA networks site and OpenRSA. Decisions on specific
actions will be made on the day.\
