### []()10 lessons for organisations about supporting more networked innovation {#toc1}

\
**1. Start with relationships, not transactions**\
If the goal is to encourage people to work together on issues about
which they feel passionate, organisations need to provide platforms for
people to meet, build relationships and earn one another’s trust. This
approach, centred on building relationships, will be more fruitful in
the long run than thinking in terms of new products and services.\
\
**2. Be clear about the invitation**\
Even when the focus is on building relationships, there needs to be a
clearly stated invitation that explains to people what is on offer, how
they can get involved, what is being asked of them, and what they stand
to gain from becoming a participant. This can take time to develop, but
it is well worth the effort: an unclear invitation creates anxiety and
frustration, which in turns leads to disengagement and disillusionment.\
\
**3. People need to be seen and heard**\
When people do decide to get involved and give freely of their time and
energy, this effort needs to be recognised. In the culture of networks,
such recognition can come in the form of a thank you as much as a
paycheque, a new set of connections as much as a job title. Generosity
and mutuality lie at the heart of networks and failure to ‘see and hear’
people will result in the failure of any network-based initiative.\
\
**4. Follow exciting leads**\
The best ideas can be found in surprising places, and networked
innovation is not a linear process. There should always be space in the
plan to follow unexpected leads, and it should be made as easy as
possible for people to bring in their own connections and networks to
increase the chances of a new idea emerging.\
\
**5. Understand an online presence as integral to the mission**\
Online spaces for networking don’t work unless they are clearly
connected to a wider set of activities that mix face-to-face meetings
with virtual discussions. Once created, sites need to be easy to amend
as people’s requirements change. If they are for a large and diverse
audience, the needs of both the intensive and the occasional user must
be catered for in equal measure.\
\
**6. Understand patterns of participation**\
Any organisation that sets out to get everyone participating all of the
time is doomed to fail.Participation needs to be understood in terms of
when and how, rather than as an either/or question. This is an important
principle and must be reflected in every aspect of the change project’s
design, including its success criteria.\
\
**7. Not every networked idea is a good idea, or appropriate**\
Networks are not the same as a free-for-all where anyone’s idea carries.
There is still ample room for judgement in networks: the difference is
that the criteria for judging are shared, transparent, and consistently
used. Networks centred on innovation need to allow for the fact that
ideas arrive at different states of development, and therefore there
should be a number of ‘ways in’, depending on how developed the idea
is.\
\
**8. Revel in reflected glory**\
The most successful networked approaches to change think about their
mission, not their organisation – and this in turn requires a degree of
humility and a willingness to share in success rather than claim it all
to the organisation. Commitment is what drives people on to achieve
social change – and people are more excited by missions than by
organisational goals.\
\
**9. Let networked innovation models change the hierarchy**\
The true potential of new networks will not be realised unless they can
be integrated with the hierarchy, rather than be grafted on to it. The
goal is not necessarily to eliminate the hierarchy altogether – but it
does need to change if it is to successfully and meaningfully support
the action being carried by new networks. This can be challenging work.\
\
**10. Don’t lose the human touch when going to scale**\
Networks are based on relationships and trust, both of which still
require a ‘human touch’. Scale can only be achieved organically, and
from the ground up: a decree from head office will not create a
sustainable model. Networks need to be imagined as a series of
connections or nodes, rather than one central hub around which
everything else revolves, and this must drive the growth strategy.\
\
### []()Lessons for managing the process of change {#toc2}

\
**1. Embrace chaos**\
The start of any major change process is inevitably uncomfortable and
confusing. This has to be allowed for, as people re-orient themselves to
new realities. Attempts to move too quickly to a more planned phase
risks failing to generate ownership of the change project.\
\
**2. Co-design change to ensure relentless focus on the experience of
participants.**\
Organisations often forget that their customers and users are important
sources of insight and ideas. Finding ways of unlocking this through the
change process is important for long-term success. Much can be learnt
from design disciplines, which are routinely used by many of the most
successful organisations around the world to help them see their service
offerings from a true customer perspective, in order to improve those
services.\
\
**3. Prototype, incubate and learn**\
Where there is no blueprint for change, the only way of reaching a new
destination is to experiment and then reflect. Doing this at a small
scale initially is a way of managing the risks associated with change:
it is through this process that organisations can determine which
aspects of current ways of operating should be carried forward, and
which should be discarded.\
\
**4. Mix mavericks and managers**\
All change projects need a mixture of inspiration and perspiration.
Charismatic leadership plays an essential part of galvanising action and
inspiring courage; but it needs to be accompanied by a more enabling
form of leadership that is centred on empowering the team to carry the
project forward.\
\
**5. Go beyond staff compliance: you need their deep commitment**\
Major change processes will not be sustained in the long term by
compliance or exhortation. Hard work needs to be put in to gaining wide
ownership of any change process and what it is trying to achieve.\
