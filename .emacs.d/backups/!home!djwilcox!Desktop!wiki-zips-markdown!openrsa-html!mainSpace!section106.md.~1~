# []()Section 106 Agreements {#toc0}

\
I’ve noticed over a long time that Section 106 agreements seem dificult
to track dwon?\
\
During a planning process the documents will be in the public library,
if there is public consultation?\
\
I also haven’t worked out how to put pages where, so will hold the rest
of thing for now.\
\
At the moment recent changes is the only way I can find something again.
