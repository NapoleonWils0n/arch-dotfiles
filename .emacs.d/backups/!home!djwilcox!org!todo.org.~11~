Try changing to ownership of the .plist file, as noted here.

sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
sudo chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
It is also worth noting that these root LaunchDaemons can't be world writable, for security reasons:

sudo chmod o-w /Library/LaunchDaemons/*

Can also be done with a single command: sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist – Eric Mar 25 at 16:06
