## []()Developing OpenRSA.net and OpenRSA {#toc0}

\
These are opening thoughts from past discussions, plus ***entirely
personal*** first suggestions on how development of an OpenRSA.net site,
events, other tools and associated projects might develop. The main idea
here is that development should tap the enthusiasm of members (1), meet
their needs to develop discussion and projects, and also model and so
influence the way that we hope RSA Networks might develop.\
The early history and principles of OpenRSA [are
here](about.html){.wiki_link}. It was conceived as an open, flexible
group to support development of the RSA and RSAN, engaging through the
use of social media and occasional events.\
Current thoughts are catalysed by the proposal for an [OpenRSA.net
site](OpenRSA.net%20proposal.html){.wiki_link}, but I’m assuming OpenRSA
activities will not be confined to that site, and can continue even if
the site is not developed as proposed.\
This is a bit of brain-dump that needs a lot refinement. I hope it can
be shorter. **Please** feel free to add/amend/delete. You need to join
the wiki to do that - link at top of the page. First draft by David
Wilcox November 1 2008 (2) **.**\
\
*I hope that this note might help create* ***a framework for a first
virtual and/or face-to-face meeting** to develop OpenRSA.net and OpenRSA
as a whole. See suggested next steps below.*\
\
**Summary**\
[OpenRSA.net](OpenRSA.net%20proposal.html){.wiki_link}, together with
other online tools, events, and activities becomes the basis for an
Innovation Lab that helps fast-track RSAN projects and evolve processes
that will help build the wider network and engage external interests. It
is a project developed by the OpenRSA group within RSAN that also has an
outward-facing presence.\
\
**What is OpenRSA, what are we trying to achieve**\
-   An **open group/network** of RSA Fellows, and others interested in
    development of RSA, on the lines [first set out
    here](about.html){.wiki_link}. While development will be led by
    Fellows/members, we warmly invite the involvement of RSA staff
    and Trustees.
-   A distributed, networked structure, not a hierarchy. Open to anyone
    to join - as above. Conducting activities openly.
-   Operating as an **Innovation Lab**, where people are encouraged to
    explore new ideas for the collaborative use of social media, and
    other methods, for social change.
-   A set of online places, events and activities with enough
    organisational structure to support these activities - but no more.
-   Broadly in line with the original RSAN vision, and aiming to assist
    development of RSAN through its examples of processes and projects.
-   Exploring governance and management structures and processes best
    suited to the emerging networked world.

\
**Governance and management model**\
-   The governance and management model should be designed to suit the
    purpose of an Innovation Lab, where activities are distributed
    geographically, across different interest groups, using a number of
    different communication methods. So:
-   The OpenRSA.net site, if it can be developed, will act as the
    aggregator and hub of activities.. The core governance and
    management issues will be around that site. First proposals for [a
    user-run site are here](OpenRSA.net%20proposal.html){.wiki_link}.
-   There will be **no formal OpenRSA governing body**. There will be
    appropriate governance and management for the site(s), events, and
    any innovation projects, operating within a broad set of
    OpenRSA principles. These principles will be evolved online and at
    events by members (1). We are not trying to set up an organisation
    within an organisation (the RSA).
-   The core organising of OpenRSA sites and events will be on a
    voluntary basis. See below for projects.

\
**Projects**\
-   There are some first ideas on areas of activity in the [OpenRSA.net
    proposal](OpenRSA.net%20proposal.html){.wiki_link}.
-   Projects will make their own arrangements for voluntary or paid-for
    resources, and will expect to be part of the wider RSAN community.
    We are not aiming to develop a set of projects outside RSAN, but
    rather **fast-track open, collaborative social innovation projects**
    that are particularly helpful to the wider development of RSAN.
-   We would expect some projects to be internally focussed - around
    development processes, communication, sites and events - and some be
    be externally focussed as part of the wider assembly of projects
    developed as part of RSAN.
-   Any OpenRSA projects - internal or external - will be open: that is,
    designed to share experience more widely, and engaging with external
    interests as well as RSA Fellows and staff. Where people feel this
    degree of openness is inappropriate to their RSAN project they can
    decide simply to share some, but not all, information
    through OpenRSA.

\
**Sites and events**\
-   The **main site will be OpenRSA.net**. Other sites, online spaces
    and tools - like the [Virtual Coffee
    House](Virtual%20Coffee%20House.html){.wiki_link} - will be
    developed to meet the needs of members, support projects, and model
    possible innovations within the wider RSAN.
-   There will be a commitment in organising synchronous events -
    physically and online - to meet the needs of a geographically
    distributed community. Groups can form locally or regionally, or
    around interests.

\
**Process**\
-   One explicit project could be the process to develop OpenRSA: the
    sites, events, project guidance and wider engagement with RSAN. A
    **core development process group** could move this forward without
    aiming to “represent” members of OpenRSA. Their activities would be
    guided by others through interactions online and off.

\
**Roles**\
-   Members can identify **specific roles** and activities they would
    like to occupy or support at the core or within projects. These
    might include site manager, technical support, events organiser,
    facilitator, project leader, etc. (3)

\
**Engaging RSA and RSAN**\
-   While OpenRSA activities must have primary value in their own right
    for members (otherwise as volunteers they will not commit time and
    enthusiasm), one main purpose is to **help with the evolution of RSA
    Networks** as a whole.
-   In the first instance, we are asking RSA to agree to the OpenRSA.net
    proposal, by which the current networks.thersa.org propotype site
    becomes the hub for the Innovation Lab, with an invitation to those
    registered on the site to participate. This would then proceed in
    parallel with the new networks.thersa.org which is under development
    by Squiz as part of the main RSA site.
-   If we proceed as an Innovation Lab, we could invite RSA staff to be
    involved, and with them design some activities specifically to help
    development of RSAN. However OpenRSA.net project leaders have to be
    free to pursue their own objectives within a broad RSAN vision, and
    not be constrained by any current operating conditions. Otherwise
    this will cease to be an Innovation Lab.

\
**Suggested next steps**\
-   Make these notes available to the [OpenRSA Google
    group](http://groups.google.com/group/openrs){.wiki_link_ext}
    members, and invite immediate comments.
-   If broadly agreed, set up a development group to move the process
    forward and organise a first virtual and/or physical event.
-   Share these proposals with RSA staff and seek their advice on how
    best to further engage with RSA/RSAN on the OpenRSA.net proposals in
    the first instance.

**Notes**\
(1) I’m using the term members to avoid distinction between Fellows,
people who have applied to be Fellows, and others who wish to be
associated with OpenRSA. The nature of membership, and roles within
OpenRSA, is one issue to be discussed. DW\
(2) I should declare a personal interest in sharing developments with
other people interested in membership organisations, through the
[Membership Project](http://www.commonspace.org.uk){.wiki_link_ext}
which started at RSAN and is supported by RSA and NCVO. The Membership
Project is an example of a project started within RSAN that now has its
own site. My thinking on past RSAN development is [documented
here](http://designingcollaboration.wikispaces.com/RSA){.wiki_link}. DW\
(3) If useful, I’ll commit to the role of social reporter which I’m
[exploring here](http://socialreporter.com){.wiki_link_ext}. That would
involve helping surface and summarise conversations, create a developing
narrative, evolve online tools - and help others do the same. That way
we would, hopefully, have a growing group of people helping animate the
conversations online and face to face, providing reflection upon
progress by the Lab. If people are interested, social reporting can be a
project in its own right. DW
