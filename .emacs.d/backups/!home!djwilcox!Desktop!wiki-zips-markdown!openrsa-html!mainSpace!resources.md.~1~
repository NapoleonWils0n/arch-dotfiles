[About RSA
Fellowship](http://www.thersa.org/fellowship){.wiki_link_ext}\
The RSA’s work is supported by an international Fellowship of 27,000
people. These achievers and influencers come from an extraordinary range
of backgrounds and are committed to civic innovation and social
progress.\
\
[About RSA
Networks](http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/rsa-networks){.wiki_link_ext}\
RSA Networks is exploring new ways of engaging and empowering Fellows to
become a dynamic network of social change makers and innovators. [CEO
Matthew Taylor’s
vision](Matthew%20Taylor%27s%20vision.html){.wiki_link}.\
\
[RSA Fellowship Networks - online networks
platform](http://www.thersa.org/networksplatform){.wiki_link_ext} (login
required)\
The RSA seeks to develop and promote new ways of thinking about human
fulfilment and social progress. We do this by providing a forum for
ideas and debate, a programme of innovative research and development,
and through the activities of our 27,000 strong Fellowship. The RSA
platform has been designed to facilitate this vision. It is an online
community with space to propose ideas for projects and then share,
discuss, develop and support them.\

**Manchester event November 20 2008**\
Over 100 Fellows met to review what it meant to be a Fellow. RSA chief
executive Matthew Taylor [blogged the
event](http://www.thersa.org/about-us/matthews-blog-archive/archives/november-2008/reporting-back-from-the-manchester-exchange-fellows-meeting-...){.wiki_link_ext}
and encouraged Fellows to form their own connections and groups:\
“In a group to discuss communication, a Fellow who had been quiet up to
then suddenly burst out: ‘you mean, if I want to, I can just contact
local Fellows and start a local group; I don’t need permission from
London or the regional committee?’ Exactly.”\

## []()From NESTA {#toc1}

NESTA, the National Endowment for Science, Tevhnology and the Arts,
invested £100,000 in development of RSA Networks, and also commissioned
evaluations.\
\
### []()Evaluation of RSA Networks {#toc2}

[Interim
evaluation](http://www.commonspace.org.uk/blog/sophia-parker/interim-evaluation-rsa-networks-project){.wiki_link_ext}\
Consultant author Sophia Parker wrote: “We need to understand much, much
more about what this ‘new collectivism’ might mean for organisations of
the future. The mediating role that they have played in our lives is
looking increasingly redundant as each of us as individuals find tools
to work together in new ways”.\

\
### []()Final evaluation {#toc3}

The evaluation took the form of a report and principles for networks
innovation, [on the NESTA
website](http://www.nesta.org.uk/rsa-networks/){.wiki_link_ext}.\
“The report sets out what we hope will be a useful set of lessons for
those who want to learn more about supporting networked innovation or
managing change. A series of videos filmed throughout the project will
be available for download from this website soon.”\
The [principles are available
here.](Principles%20for%20networked%20innovation.html){.wiki_link}\
