# []()Re-inventing membership in a networked society {#toc0}

\
This a more detailed explanation of the project proposal posted to the
[RSA Networks
site](http://networks.thersa.org/discuss/re-inventing-membership-longer-version){.wiki_link_ext}
December 19 2007\
\
**Short version**\
Membership organisations and associations are fundamental to civic life
- but may be bypassed as online social networking grows. This project
will invite organisations - and anyone interested - to join with RSA
Networks to explore practical ways to meet the challenge.\
\
**Longer version**\
Membership organisations and associations are at the heart of civic
life, but research suggests few recognise the coming challenges of a
more networked society**.** Organisations may be bypassed as members use
social media and networks to find information, services, and ways to
organise. Or - like the RSA - organisations can rethink their current
structures and relationships to members.\
This project will invite forward-looking civic organisations to join RSA
Networks in exploring the implications of social networking for civic
institutions, and the practical implications of using social media,
creative events, and new ways of organising for civic innovation.\
We will draw on work already undertaken by the NCVO Third Sector
Foresight Unit, and with their agreement invite the Unit, and
practitioners involved in their technology network, to join us.\
Some of the greatest opportunities for innovation lie in rural life.
Ruralnet UK has pioneered the use of online systems for the past 10
years, and chief executive Simon Berry FRSA is a co-sponsor of the
project.\
We will run a workshop early in 2008 to co-design project plans in more
detail. However, from discussions to date we would expect the project to
involve:\
-   Collation of current research and thinking about membership
    organisations in a networked society, in association with NCVO Third
    Sector Foresight
-   Development of briefing and workshop tools to help organisations
    think what the future may hold, and what they can do.
-   Events - hosted initially by RSA if possible
-   Collaborative work on online systems, skills development, and
    organising creative events.
