\
### []()RSA Networks: a few thoughts before the workshop… {#toc2}

Over the course of 2007, a series of conversations with Fellows has
revealed a perceived gap: between your desire to engage with the RSA to
bring about positive social change, and the opportunities afforded to do
so. Time and again you have told us that you would like to find more
meaningful ways of working together. And while many of you have high
praise for our full and varied programme of lectures and projects, you
also said that you want to find a way of moving from being an audience
to being participants and collaborators.\
\
The change of leadership this time last year presented an opportunity to
respond to these views. The RSA networks project, which began earlier
this year, has been designed to open up this conversation to as many
people as possible and address some fundamental questions:\
\
***Do Fellows really want a deeper kind of engagement with the RSA?\
What is it that Fellows would like to change about the interactions
between themselves and the organisation?***\
\
These are \$64 million questions, but over the course of this project we
hope to be able to answer them with a greater degree of confidence and
clarity. The event you are attending on the 22nd November is a chance
for us to work together on addressing these issues and will be founded
on the key question: **what might new RSA networks do and how might they
deliver?**\
\
The day has been designed so that you, the Fellows, shape the agenda. We
are using ‘open space’ techniques so that you can organise yourselves
around the issues that excite and interest you.\
\
In that spirit, this paper is intended to stimulate your thinking before
participating in the session. It’s not a blueprint, or a position
statement, and that is very important. If Fellows are to move from the
periphery to the centre of the organisation, then it is essential that
as Fellows, you are fully engaged at every step of the process, as
collaborators and co-creators along with the staff of the organisation.
So please treat the thinking here as a springboard for your own views
and ideas: challenge it, develop it and add to it.\
\
Put simply, the RSA is ready and willing to commit to a new partnership
with Fellows—if that is what Fellows want. But we cannot and should not
make this trans- formation unless it is led and shaped by the collective
energy, appetite and wisdom of the Fellowship.\
\
### []()What do you want out of the 22nd? {#toc3}

Of course, many of you are already involved in a wide range of projects
and networks both professionally and personally. So we need to think
about what value the RSA can add to these initiatives.\
\
With such a diverse range of people coming, it’s inevitable that people
will all get different things out of the day. But what is it you would
like to achieve? Is it:\
-   Discovering a new project to get involved in?
-   Proposing a project and finding some collaborators?
-   Developing thinking around how RSA networks might work in the
    future?
-   New contacts?
-   Good conversation?

\
For the team at the RSA charged with looking after this project, this
event is a real opportunity to work with Fellows to understand more
about where your passions lie, the level and extent of engagement you
are looking for, and how ambitious we as a group want to be.\
\
### []()What should the RSA look and feel like in two years’ time? {#toc4}

Imagine the RSA in two years time, if the RSA Networks project has been
successful. What would it look like and how would it work? We don’t have
a fixed idea yet ourselves, as the modus operandi that we are exploring
through this project depends so much on the energy and commitment of the
Fellowship.\
\
That said, whatever happens, we are absolutely committed to opening up
the Fellowship, enabling it to operate as a more connected, navigable,
powerful and self-organising network. As some of you already know from
your involvement in its development, we are creating a sophisticated yet
accessible networking platform to enable Fellows to connect and
collaborate with each other in new ways. We will be sharing an early
prototype of this platform with you on the 22nd.\
\
It will feel a little like the newly launched Innovation Exchange for
the third sector (
[http://innovation-exchange.org](http://innovation-exchange.org/){.wiki_link_ext}[)](http://innovation-exchange.org/%29){.wiki_link_ext},
a marketplace for new ideas, a space where Fellows can post new project
ideas and a chance to tap into the collective wisdom and connections of
a diverse and thoughtful group of people. In other words, the Fellowship
will become more ‘searchable’, more visible and more accessible.\
\
Through this, we hope that the Fellowship begins to understand itself as
a complex, innovative network, powered through online tools as well as
offline get- togethers, buzzing with ideas. Judging from the traffic on
the RSA Networks blog (
<http://mtblog.typepad.com/rsa_networks>[)](http://mtblog.typepad.com/rsa_networks/%29){.wiki_link_ext},
this is an aspiration that many of you share too.\
\
We also know that in order to strengthen the connections between busy
Fellows, we can help by offering tools and techniques for those of you
wishing to do work together as a network. Tools might include
‘routemaps’ or ‘guidebooks’, designed to share learning around popular
Fellows’ causes, for example how to influence planning decisions in your
local area. These could be published online, so that Fellows can work
together to improve them.\
\
But what if Fellows want to go further? What if you want more than just
a better way of connecting with other Fellows? Below, we offer up a few
thoughts we’ve had about how the RSA could change to bring about a
deeper level of engagement with Fellows.\
\
These are big changes and ones that we could only make with energy and
commitment from Fellows. So, what do you think? What other suggestions
do you have?\
\
### []()RSA staff as facilitators and brokers {#toc5}

Above and beyond the online resources outlined above, we could create a
‘field team’ of regional facilitators, sometimes Fellows themselves;
sometimes staff, whose primary role is to support, challenge and develop
emergent networks. This team would be ably supported by core staff at
RSA headquarters, whose primary role would be to provide research
support and a form of ‘concierge’ or brokerage service. That brokerage
service would connect networks together if they had not already done so
themselves, as well as building partnerships between networks and other
key institutions and organisations.\
\
### []()The RSA as a Fellow-led ‘clearing house’ for ideas, and co-created projects {#toc6}

Much as it is now, but perhaps more explicitly, the content of the RSA’s
research programme could be shaped to reflect the concerns and
enthusiasms of the Fellowship, tapping into the energy and commitment
amongst Fellows for action. Fellows could be involved as co-designers
and project team members in areas identified by Fellows as priorities
for RSA work. We could see Fellows forming ‘self-organised’ networks;
networks which are connected to more substantial resources (such as
funding, venues, or expertise); or even networks which formed the basis
of a RSA research programme. Fellows could generate ideas for new
projects at regular national and regional network symposia, working
together with RSA staff to decide how to prioritise the allocation of
resources and support.\
\
### []()Getting started: what do we want to work on? {#toc7}

As part of the process of booking your place for the event on the 22nd,
we asked you all what issues really mattered to you, and what you really
care about. We did this because we know that one essential and powerful
dimension of what we call ‘civic innovation’ is its voluntary and
spontaneous nature. People’s passion and motivations are what matter.
Without those things, we’d have nothing.\
\
Fellows’ interests were broad and wide-ranging. Popular themes included
education and skills for the 21st century, social justice and human
rights, civic participation and social responsibility, the environment
and sustainable living, young people’s social and cultural needs, and
regeneration.\
\
As well as the questions we asked all of you, we have also been
gathering up many ideas from across the Fellowship about projects that
you’d like to do. To provide you with some food for thought about issues
you might like to work on with others, we’ve listed a few of them below.
Do any of these resonate with you? What other projects would you like to
propose to other Fellows on the 22nd?\
\
### []()Ten possibilities? {#toc8}

-   Building on the success of the Opening Minds curriculum, could the
    RSA connect Fellows in the creative and cultural sector with Fellows
    working in business and education to design a new kind of skills
    development programme for creative and social entrepreneurship?
    Could the RSA support this work by connecting it to other
    influential organisations and people working on this agenda
    internationally?
-   Could the RSA support the Fellowship in a number of market towns to
    re-imagine their high streets, through a participatory process of
    engagement and discussion, coupled with partnerships that promise
    the translation of that discussion into real change? Could the
    lessons we learn be documented in a ‘guidebook’ for other Fellows in
    other towns to use themselves?
-   Could the RSA Carbon team and Fellows in the Wales and West Region
    host a major on and off line public debate about the proposed Severn
    Barrage (arguably the biggest issue in the region for the decade to
    come)? In an already polarised debate, our aim would be to ensure
    that the discussion is based upon the best science, genuinely
    engages with the public, and works towards as much consensus
    as possible.
-   Could the South West region bring together Fellows to challenge
    current thinking on strategies for reducing reoffending, working
    with local prisons to build a vision based upon this, rather than
    managing those already imprisoned? By working with the RSA Prisons
    project team, could these Fellows create a blueprint for a new
    approach to offender management and incarceration? By working with
    local businesses, could Fellows develop a new model of giving former
    offenders meaningful skills and employment?
-   Could Fellows come together to form an activist investment fund? The
    RSA’s Tomorrow’s Investor project is beginning an investigation of
    the effects of the “imperfect delegation” of ownership respon-
    sibility to pension fund managers, investment fund managers and
    the like. Could Fellows form a network of trust in which information
    is shared and discussed? Or could they go further and take a more
    active role in the companies they own, albeit indirectly?
-   Could the RSA Education team and Fellows in a town work with local
    schools, the youth service and other partners to hold a high profile
    attitude- shifting debate about how young people can get on better
    together, driving violence out of their relationships? If this
    process generated new ideas and policies, could we scale up from
    this experiment to a model that could be adopted by government and
    other areas?
-   Could the Nottingham Fellows be supported in pursuing the idea of a
    Speakers Corner (a local space for people to openly debate
    topical issues) and if they succeed could we use that learning so
    that other groups around the country could replicate it? Imagine RSA
    Speakers Corners in twenty cities across the UK!
-   Could all the Fellows working within small and medium sized
    enterprises come together to explore how these organisations can
    make a positive contribution to the climate change agenda? So often
    the debate is centred on the largest multinationals, but identifying
    and then tackling the many barriers that SMEs face when trying to
    operate sustainably – environmentally and financially – could make a
    massive difference overall.
-   Could a group of Fellows work together with drug users and people
    suffering from debilitating mental health issues, to model a new,
    person- centred, community-led approach to recovery? Could these
    Fellows receive training and support from the organisations who are
    pioneering this model, so that they become advocates, as well as
    increasing the capacity of such organisations to take on and
    challenge the standard approach to dealing with these issues?
-   Could our leading Fellows from the worlds of publishing, journalism,
    music and the arts come together to reflect on the challenges
    presented to their industries by the advance of the internet and the
    democratisation of art in all its forms? Could this network begin to
    shape a new understanding of what constitutes ‘intellectual
    property’ in this context, and test and develop new, more
    sustainable business models that are fit for purpose in the 21st
    century?

\
***But what possibilities do you see?***\
\
Many of you are already involved in initiatives or jobs in these areas.
So what is it that you could do with the RSA that goes beyond that? How
can you engage in these issues in new and exciting ways via the RSA? How
can the organisation help you to do so?\
\
A further challenge for us to address is whether we have a shared vision
of what constitutes ‘innovation’. It’s a slippery term, and one person’s
innovation may be another person’s ancient history. Since the start of
the RSA networks project, we have been thinking about different kinds of
innovation. Some innovation may be about finding a new way of tackling a
given problem more effectively – for example, building the kinds of
skills people need to be successful in the 21st century.\
\
Other innovations may demand that we redefine the problem entirely in
the first place – for example, seeing social care as being less about
‘treatment’ and more about enabling people to lead the kind of life they
aspire to. What does innovation mean to you? Is it about challenging a
set of givens? Is it about reframing the problem – and therefore the
range of solutions?\
\
However, with that caveat, we believe that the RSA is in an incredibly
powerful position to generate innovation. A growing body of research
indicates that innovation is likely to emerge from collaboration – and
more significantly, collaboration across boundaries – something that our
huge and diverse Fellowship could do on an impressive scale if we can
create the right conditions. What else needs to be in place to unlock
this massive potential?\
\
### []()What would a ‘network of civic innovation’ look like? {#toc9}

As we move towards the 22nd, many Fellows have asked what the Fellowship
as a ‘network for civic innovation’ would actually look like in
practice. The truth is, we will need to build this picture together: it
depends how much time, energy and commitment Fellows wish to give to the
RSA and each other.\
\
As mentioned earlier, at the very least we want to do more to meet
Fellows’ desires to make stronger, deeper connections with one another.
But if the appetite is there to deepen the connection between the
Fellowship and the organisation – to form networks around projects that
challenge existing thinking – we will need to build our vision up from
some important principles about networked models of change. So what are
the implications of that?\
\
First and foremost, we know that a networked model of change is about
much more than ‘networking’ alone. Networks need both processes and
content. Extensive research about such models – in technology, education
and elsewhere – shows that really powerful networks have the following
assets and qualities:\
-   A well-articulated and shared set of goals, and a plan for how to
    meet those goals.
-   All members feel able and encouraged to participate – which in turn
    requires accessible, open channels of communication online
    and offline.
-   All network members perceive themselves to have an active role in
    doing work - between meetings and dialogue – so that the network
    does not become a talking shop.
-   A good balance of network leadership (sometimes shared by people)
    and facilitation that is designed to maintain momentum and
    provide challenge.

\
So, to make this model come alive, the Fellows involved in networks will
themselves need to do a good deal of the work. However it is also true
that if this is where the RSA networks project takes us, it will have
implications for the staff roles at the RSA as well.\
\
The period following the event is a real opportunity to test out and
explore what both Fellows and staff will need to do to support any
networks that emerge from the work we will be doing together on the
22nd.\
\
However, what matters most at this early stage of RSA Networks project,
is to understand how ambitious you, the Fellows, wish to be. We want to
bring you all together on the 22nd, as a fascinating, active, interested
group of Fellows who have expressed a desire to get more involved.\
We have designed the day to put you in charge: the facilitation
technique that will be used means that you will be setting the agenda.\
\
So: over to you. We hope you are looking forward to it as much as we
are\
