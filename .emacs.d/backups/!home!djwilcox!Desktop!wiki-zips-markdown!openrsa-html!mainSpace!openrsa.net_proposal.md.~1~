*This page date from 2008, when there were discussions about how to
develop online systems following first prototyping*\
\
This is a proposal for OpenRSA.net - a website that builds on the
technical and social developments of the [RSA
Networks](http://networks.thersa.org/){.wiki_link_ext} project, and on
the conversations that ensued on the [OpenRSA google
group](http://groups.google.com/group/openrs){.wiki_link_ext}.\
\
**The mission of this site is to:**\
-   Continue the action research started by the RSA Networks project on
    a voluntary basis.
-   Continue to evolve and discuss new ways for users of the site to
    collaborate on and offline.
-   Feed back results of this continued research to the RSA for possible
    integration with their ongoing RSA Networks programme.
-   Be a place where RSA Fellows and Non-Fellows can contribute to
    the project.

\
**The site will be run by its users:**\
-   Any changes to the functioning of the site or actions effecting all
    users will be decided by discussion on the site, followed by
    majority vote in an online poll. This decision-making structure may
    itself be modified in this way.
-   The site will be hosted and managed by a team of volunteers. Anyone
    may volunteer to join that team.
-   Responsibilities and roles to be discussed to ensure that the
    project achieves its aims and doesn’t drift.

\
**OpenRSA.net will start by:**\
-   Moving the prototype:
    [http://networks.thersa.org](http://networks.thersa.org/){.wiki_link_ext}
    to a new domain:
    [http://openrsa.net](http://openrsa.net/){.wiki_link_ext} to clearly
    delineate it from the new platform.
-   Re-writing the content of the site to explain the changes.
-   Messaging all current users, explaining the new mission and
    structure of the site, inviting them to ‘opt in’.
-   Both staff and volunteers facilitating discussion on the site, and
    keeping information flowing between RSA and OpenRSA.

\
**Areas of possible future discussion** (as illustrated by the [Virtual
Coffee House Vision](Virtual%20Coffee%20House.html){.wiki_link} paper):\
-   Conversation management systems.
-   Live conferencing.
-   Exploring online and face-to-face behaviour patterns.
-   Investigate the system nuances of managing
    privacy/transparency/translucency issues and understanding their
    role in encouraging/discouraging participation.
-   Enhancing systems to visualise realistic levels of activity
    within RSAN.
-   New schemes to generate interest in the RSAN.
-   Further research the natural dynamics within knowledge networks in
    order to synthesise an online environment conducive
    to collaboration.
-   Promoting the social innovation activities both within the
    Fellowship and more widely.
-   Explore the opportunities, boundaries, roles and responsibilities of
    co-managing a volunteer/RSA online community.
