## About OpenRSA

This page was written in May 2012, since when the idea of relaunching
OpenRSA has been put on hold. On reflection, and from a wide range of
conversations, it may be more productive to focus development of an
innovation space to pilot ideas for the RSA we would like to see. The
next RSA. David Wilcox

OpenRSA was started by a group of Fellows in 2007 to support the vision
of the new chief executive Matthew Taylor, who saw the 27,000-strong RSA
Fellowship as an outward-looking force for social innovation. A great
deal has been achieved since then, through local and special interest
networks, Catalyst grants for Fellow-led projects, a dedicated staff
team, and a Fellowship Council.

The [Fellowship Charter of 2010](http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/apply/uk)
confirms the vision, saying: "We form a unique combination of
committed people and diverse ways of working in our efforts to find
innovative practical solutions to pressing social problems" and “We
support each other by working collaboratively and creating an
enlightened space in which to tackle the challenges of the 21st
century”.\
\
OpenRSA is planning a relaunch to help create that “enlightened space”,
and stronger networks for Fellows, because:\
-   The climate is right internally to do more. There is renewed
    encouragement for Fellow-led projects, and staff-Fellow
    collaborations
-   The need to support citizen-led action and social innovation is
    widely recognised. Fellows can help.
-   A new RSA technology strategy offer the potential for better online
    spaces, but these may not be available for a year or so.
-   Regional Fellowship networks are keen to explore new ways
    to develop.
-   A Fellowship survey showed better networking as a high priority, but
    staff resources are stretched and more be achieved with support
    from Fellows.
-   There is strong demand for physical spaces to meet, but limited
    access to RSA facilities in London. New informal spaces should soon
    be available, providing better networking opportunities.

\
Over the past three years the [RSA digital engagement
group](http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement)
has acted as a focus for collaboration between Fellows and staff to
explore and develop new ways forward. In May 2012 the group launched [a network for Regional Digital Champions](http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement/forum/topics/launch-of-rsa-digital-champions),
and also supported an [initial exploration into how Fellows could collaborate to create a more fully networked RSA](http://rsafellowship.com/group/digitalengagement/forum/topics/collaborating-towards-a-more-fully-networked-rsa)\
\
This led to two initiatives:\
1.  Relaunch of OpenRSA as a time-limited exploration to help improve
    networking and collaboration among Fellows through a mix of methods,
    and to help connect this with wider initiatives for social and
    community action. We will shortly have a blog at
    [OpenRSA.org](http://openrsa.org)Meanwhile [more here about this exploration](exploration.md).
2.  More detailed exploration through the RSA digital engagement group
    of how Fellows could collaborate to provide interim solutions,
    pending full implementation of the technology strategy,
