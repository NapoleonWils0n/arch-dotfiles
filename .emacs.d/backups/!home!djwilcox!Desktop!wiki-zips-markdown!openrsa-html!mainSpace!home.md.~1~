*The OpenRSA initiative was started in 2007 to support new developments
planned for the 250-year-old
[RSA](http://www.thersa.org/){.wiki_link_ext} - the Royal Society for
the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce. OpenRSA was
particularly active autumn 07- spring 08 around the launch of RSA
Networks. [Original statement

*<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The ideas below were developed
in May 2012, since when the idea of relaunching OpenRSA has been put on
hold. However, we may relaunch in the light of discussions about the RSA
mission - [summarised here](http://bit.ly/ZD29nM){.wiki_link_ext}- and
others about RSA Fellowship [on

\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">OpenRSA is conceived as an open
collaborative exploration over six months, starting in June 2012, around
the theme:</span>\
\
*<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How can RSA Fellows contribute
to the organisationâ€™s mission - and benefit from the experience in ways
that suit their needs as well?</span>*\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The exploration will be
conducted partly online, and also through meetings and workshops. It is
a Fellow-led initiative in support of staff-led developments for the
Fellowship, and the technology platform. We aim to work closely with
staff throughout.</span>\
