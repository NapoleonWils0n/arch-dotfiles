[2016-08-07 Sun 15:55] Emacs as Daemon on OS X using Launchd

If you’re running Emacs 23, you can run Emacs As Daemon via OS X’s launchd. The easiest solution is to use a tool like Lingon to create the plist file or can create one manually like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> 
     <plist version="1.0">
      <dict> 
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>gnu.emacs.daemon</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</string>
          <string>--daemon</string>
        </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>ServiceDescription</key>
       <string>Gnu Emacs Daemon</string>
       <key>UserName</key>
       <string>[YOUR USERNAME HERE]</string>
      </dict>
    </plist>
#+END_EXAMPLE

This can then be installed in /Library/LaunchAgents and loaded via:

    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist

M-x magit-status to see git status, and in the status buffer:
s to stage files
c c to commit (type the message then C-c C-c to actually commit)
b b to switch to another branch
Other handy keys:

P u to do a git push
F u to do a git pull

 [2016-08-25 Thu 23:19] 15.11 org-crypt.el

 Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or properties. Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and decrypt files.

 Any text below a headline that has a ‘:crypt:’ tag will be automatically be encrypted when the file is saved. If you want to use a different tag just customize the org-crypt-tag-matcher setting.

 To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your .emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (require 'org-crypt)
      (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
      (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))
     
      (setq org-crypt-key nil)
	;; GPG key to use for encryption
	;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.
     
      (setq auto-save-default nil)
	;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
	;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
	;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
	;; start Org.
     
	;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
	;;
	;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
#+END_EXAMPLE

Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted text being encrypted again.

 [2016-08-24 Wed 22:42] Reload Org

 As of Org version 6.23b (released Sunday Feb 22, 2009) there is a new function to reload org files.

 Normally you want to use the compiled files since they are faster. If you update your org files you can easily reload them with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 If you run into a bug and want to generate a useful backtrace you can reload the source files instead of the compiled files with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 C-u M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 and turn on the "Enter Debugger On Error" option. Redo the action that generates the error and cut and paste the resulting backtrace. To switch back to the compiled version just reload again with

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 M-x org-reload
 #+END_EXAMPLE

** [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/issues/148][Export error is back · Issue #148 · yjwen/org-reveal · GitHub]] :website:
 [2016-08-24 Wed 21:57] I found this workaround solution: http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/16616/2780
 Actually only doing C-u M-x org-reload was enough in my case. But I need to run it every time I restarted emacs (fortunately that is not often).

[2016-08-19 Fri 00:53] Headings
It's all about headings in org. Headings such as this are created with * (stars). The number of stars defines the depth of the heading. Pressing <TAB> on headings will minimize/maximize them. Pressing tab multiple times in a row on headings with subheadings will maximize each subheading by depth corresponding to the number of times you pressed <TAB>.

Subheadings

Subheadings can nest within other headings such as this one. This is really convenient for organizing stuff.

"TODO"s (C-c C-t)
TODO's are created by starting headers with the keyword TODO or DONE. You can also create one with C-c C-t on a header. They are meant to represent tasks you wish to create within your organizational document. These can be helpful when planning out projects or assignments.

The TODO cycle

You can turn an existing header into a TODO item by cycling its TODO status. The shortcut for this is C-c C-t (t for todo).

Non-TODO -> TODO -> DONE -> Non-TODO … (with C-c C-t).

Lists
You can create bullets with the - (dash), numbered bullets or lists with #. (number[dot]). Tabbing multiple times changes the indentation of the bullet, but only if there is no text yet. Tabbing multiple levels can get confusing, but if you remember to <TAB> before typing - or #., things tend to work out.

Ordered Lists

item 1
item 2
sub 1
sub 2
subsub 1
Unordered Lists

Start with -, +, or *.

hello
item 2
item 3
subitem 1
sub
subsub
Description Lists

Start with -, +, or * and followed by ::

Matlab is a funny language. 
 - Scope :: Scope doesn't work as expected, and messes everything up
   when loops mix variables up in recursive functions.
 - Namespaces :: You wish. 
 - Header Files :: Nope.
gives

Matlab is a funny language.

Scope
Scope doesn't work as expected, and messes everything up when loops mix variables up in recursive functions.
Namespaces
You wish.
Header Files
Nope.
Text Formatting
Individual words can be bolded with stars, italicized with forward slashes, and underlined with underscores. Also, there is verbatim and strike-through.

*bold* /italics/ _underline_ ~verbatim~ +strike-through+
Tables
Tables can be created from any line that starts with '|' (pipe). A line that starts with '|-' (pipe dash) is considered a horizontal seperator; <TAB> after inserting it to expand the separator.

this    is      a       sample  table
move    from    one     col     to
the     other   with    <TAB>   this column
Some tips:

<TAB> realigns the columns, and moves to the next column. If at end of line, it will create a new row.
C-c C-c will realign the columns without moving or creating new ones.
<RET> moves to the next row.
Table Formatting

When exporting, tables are drawn without cell borders or frames. Here are useful table formatting commands which you place immediately before a table.

This is a table with lines around and between cells
this    is      a       sample  table
move    from    one     col     to
the     other   with    <TAB>   this column
Literal Examples
Literal examples are snippets of text or source code that need to be unformatted on org export. Put this text between #+begin-example and +end_example.

Source Code

Org-mode is great for inserting snippets of code. This can be done with the

#+BEGIN_SRC [major-mode-name] [options]
#+END_SRC
[major-mode-name] adds a lot of extra functionality to these code blocks within your org file. It's also good for whoever is reading to know what the language is.

For example:

1:  int main() { 
2:  return 0; 
3:  }
Useful options and commands.

Options:

-n : add line numbers to the source code.
+n : add line numbers but continue from last SRC snippet.
-r : remove labels from source code
Commands:

C-c ['] : Allows you to edit the source code at point in its native mode. Opens a new buffer where you exit after editing by the command again.
C-c l : calls org-store-link when editing with ~C-c '~. This creates a label at the line currently being edited. It can be retrieved later with C-c C-l.
Easy templates

It gets tiring to use the long tags if you're doing this a lot. These are shortcuts to generate the above snippet borders. To insert, type a '<' followed by a template selector and then <TAB>.

Template selectors:

s    #+begin_src ... #+end_src 
e    #+begin_example ... #+end_example
q    #+begin_quote ... #+end_quote 
v    #+begin_verse ... #+end_verse 
c    #+begin_center ... #+end_center 
l    #+begin_latex ... #+end_latex 
L    #+latex: 
h    #+begin_html ... #+end_html 
H    #+html: 
a    #+begin_ascii ... #+end_ascii 
A    #+ascii: 
i    #+index: line 
I    #+include: line 
Linking
Linking files together

You can link files together with

[[file:filename][name-of-link]]
This will preserve links after export to HTML as well.

Linking sections within a document

You can create a link to a section within your document with the section name in brackets. The second option lets you call the link something else.

[[section-title]]
[[section-title][link-title]]
Exporting (C-c C-e)
You can export org files to any of the supported formats with C-c C-e [option].

C-c C-e will show you the options available in a separate buffer. Common ones are text, html, and latex. You can get PDFs by converting to latex, but you need to have a LaTeX environment installed on your system to use this.

Export Options (C-c C-e t)

When org files are exported, certain variables are set automatically but can be manually set by you. To change a variable's value, use

#+VARIABLE-NAME: value
anywhere in your document. At the top is probably best.

To paste a template of all export options in your org document so that you can set them immediately, use (org-insert-export-options-template), or C-c C-e t.

This will print

#+TITLE:       the title to be shown (default is the buffer name)
#+AUTHOR:      the author (default taken from user-full-name)
#+DATE:        a date, an Org timestamp120, or a format string for format-time-string
#+EMAIL:       his/her email address (default from user-mail-address)
#+DESCRIPTION: the page description, e.g. for the XHTML meta tag
#+KEYWORDS:    the page keywords, e.g. for the XHTML meta tag
#+LANGUAGE:    language for HTML, e.g. ‘en’ (org-export-default-language)
#+TEXT:        Some descriptive text to be inserted at the beginning.
#+TEXT:        Several lines may be given.
#+OPTIONS:     H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
#+BIND:        lisp-var lisp-val, e.g.: org-export-latex-low-levels itemize
               You need to confirm using these, or configure org-export-allow-BIND
#+LINK_UP:     the ``up'' link of an exported page
#+LINK_HOME:   the ``home'' link of an exported page
#+LATEX_HEADER: extra line(s) for the LaTeX header, like \usepackage{xyz}
#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS:   Tags that select a tree for export
#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS:  Tags that exclude a tree from export
#+XSLT:        the XSLT stylesheet used by DocBook exporter to generate FO file
within your document, but with your actual variable values instead of descriptions. Change any of the variables to the value of your choice. These descriptions are provided here for your reference.

The #+OPTIONS variable is very useful for specific tweaks and will effect both HTML and LaTeX exports.

H:         set the number of headline levels for export
num:       turn on/off section-numbers
toc:       turn on/off table of contents, or set level limit (integer)
\n:        turn on/off line-break-preservation (DOES NOT WORK)
@:         turn on/off quoted HTML tags
::         turn on/off fixed-width sections
|:         turn on/off tables
^:         turn on/off TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If
you write "^:{}", a_{b} will be interpreted, but
the simple a_b will be left as it is.
-:         turn on/off conversion of special strings.
f:         turn on/off footnotes like this[1].
todo:      turn on/off inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
tasks:     turn on/off inclusion of tasks (TODO items), can be nil to remove
all tasks, todo to remove DONE tasks, or list of kwds to keep
pri:       turn on/off priority cookies
tags:      turn on/off inclusion of tags, may also be not-in-toc
<:         turn on/off inclusion of any time/date stamps like DEADLINES
*:         turn on/off emphasized text (bold, italic, underlined)
TeX:       turn on/off simple TeX macros in plain text
LaTeX:     configure export of LaTeX fragments.  Default auto
skip:      turn on/off skipping the text before the first heading
author:    turn on/off inclusion of author name/email into exported file
email:     turn on/off inclusion of author email into exported file
creator:   turn on/off inclusion of creator info into exported file
timestamp: turn on/off inclusion creation time into exported file
d:         turn on/off inclusion of drawers
Variables are set with nil or t, and sometimes take an argument. For example

#+OPTIONS:     H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
Title

The title is taken from the first non-comment line in the file. If there is none, ie your file starts with a heading, it uses the filename. The title can be manually set using

#+TITLE: This is the title of the document
Table of Contents

Normally inserted after the first headline, you can set manually by inserting TABLE-OF-CONTENTS inside square-brackets ([]) seperately on a line.

Some useful options are:

#+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no TOC at all)
Including Other Files

You can include files in an org document, which will be rendered on export. This is done using the single line command

#+INCLUDE: "file-path" [type] [src-language]
type can be either (quote, example, or src). if type is src, then src-language can be any major-mode language.

HTML Export

Stylesheet

You can include a stylesheet by using

#+STYLE:    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../stylesheet.css" />
The styles used by org-mode to export specific parts of your document can be set in your stylesheet with the following variables:

p.author            author information, including email
p.date              publishing date
p.creator           creator info, about org mode version
.title              document title
.todo               TODO keywords, all not-done states
.done               the DONE keywords, all states that count as done
.WAITING            each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
.timestamp          timestamp
.timestamp-kwd      keyword associated with a timestamp, like SCHEDULED
.timestamp-wrapper  span around keyword plus timestamp
.tag                tag in a headline
._HOME              each tag uses itself as a class, "@" replaced by "_"
.target             target for links
.linenr             the line number in a code example
.code-highlighted   for highlighting referenced code lines
div.outline-N       div for outline level N (headline plus text))
div.outline-text-N  extra div for text at outline level N
.section-number-N   section number in headlines, different for each level
div.figure          how to format an inlined image
pre.src             formatted source code
pre.example         normal example
p.verse             verse paragraph
div.footnotes       footnote section headline
p.footnote          footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
.footref            a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
.footnum            footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)
Site Navigation

You can verily easily add "Up" and "Home" buttons on each page with

#+LINK_UP: 
#+LINK_HOME: index.html
Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are managed by links and automatically converted to their html counterparts. See Linking Files.

Publishing
Publishing is simply automating your export pipeline. When you have many files that require export, it is a good idea to create a publishing script for this.

Publishing Script

To enable project publishing with org-mode, create a local file in the project directory with the instructions. In our example we have named it org_publish.el.

(defconst home (file-name-directory (or load-file-name buffer-file-name)))

(require 'org-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      `(
        ;; add all the components here
        ;; *notes* - publishes org files to html
        ("main-page"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/")
         :base-extension "org"  ; Filename suffix without dot
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/")
         :recursive t           ; DONT include subdirectories
         :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
         :headline-levels 4             ; Just the default for this project.
         :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../css/stylesheet.css\" />"
         :auto-preamble t
         :auto-sitemap t                ; generate automagically
         :sitemap-sort-folders last
         :sitemap-title "Main Sitemap"
         )

        ;; The meeting notes to be published
        ("meeting-notes"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/meeting-notes/")
         :base-extension "org"
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/meeting-notes/")
         :recursive nil
         :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
         :headline-levels 4
         :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../css/stylesheet.css\" />"
         :auto-preamble t
         :auto-sitemap t
         :sitemap-title "Meeting Notes Directory"
         )

        ;; *static* - copies files to directories
        ("org-static"
         :base-directory ,(concat home "org/")
         :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
         :publishing-directory ,(concat home "html/")
         :recursive t
         :publishing-function org-publish-attachment
         )

        ;; *publish* with M-x org-publish-project RET emacsclub RET
        ("emacsclub" :components ("main-page" "meeting-notes" "org-static"))
        ))

Description

This is a minor mode that runs within dired emulating many of the features of ranger. This minor mode shows a stack of the parent directories and updates the parent buffers while navigating the file system. The preview window takes some of the ideas from Peep-Dired to display previews for selected files in the primary dired buffer.

Installation

Once you have setup Melpa you can use package-install command to install Ranger. The package name is ranger.

Window conventions for Ranger

ranger mode with preview enabled 

Ranger has the ability to show the parent directories for the current working directory and also a preview for the currently selected file.

In this package, the parent windows denote any window to the left of the active ranger window. These represent the immediate parent directory of the current directory and any parents of that if ranger-parent-depth is greater than 1. If navigating the root directory, the parent window will disappear. The parent window is not expected to be interacted with; however, [ and ] will navigate up and down the parent directories, also <Mouse-1> can be used to quickly navigate to a file / folder in the parent window.

The active window is designated as the ranger or primary window. Most file activities are performed here. h and l will navigate up to the parent directory and open the selected file or directory. Opening a file in ranger is designed to close the ranger interface and revert the window configuration to its previous state.

The window on the right side is designated as the preview window. The visibility of the preview window can be toggled with the ranger-preview-file setting and the keybinding i. Files will be previewed in the preview window when selected. A raw preview of the file is set by default with the ranger-show-literal setting, but can be toggled by zi, at which case a fully formatted preview of the file will be shown. Additionally, when ranger-show-literal is disabled, images and archive contents will be shown in the preview window when selected. When a directory is selected in the ranger window, a file listing of the subdirectory will be shown.

Coming from dired

Ranger works as a replacement to dired, but there are a couple of things you have to know:

If you don't like seen windows with the parent folders, you can user the minimal ranger mode called deer (see next section).
When you open a file, the ranger session gets finalized. If you want to restore it after closing the file, just try opening ranger again (it will remember exactly the path where you were before).
Minimal Ranger Mode (deer)

Termed as deer-mode, based on the zsh module developed by Vifon, we can use ranger in a single window without preview or parent directories. This allows all the functionality built-in to ranger without modifying any other buffer windows. Toggle between ranger and deer with zp.

deer mode (minimal ranger mode) 

Setting as Default Directory Handler

Ranger has the ability to be used as the default directory handler when Emacs identifies a directory is opened. To make deer the default handler, set ranger-override-dired and restart.

(setq ranger-override-dired t)
Bookmark Navigation

Ranger makes use of the built-in bookmark functionality in Emacs by creating bookmarks with the name ranger-? where ? can be any single key. This allows fast navigation to predefined directories that are persistent across sessions. A new mark can be set with m and can be accessed with the tilde key. A prompt of all directory bookmarks can be accessed with B.

Keybinding      Description
```     goto bookmark
m       set bookmark
B       show bookmark prompt
Tab and History Usage

Ranger offers tabs to allow quick navigation between temporary working directories. These do not persist across sessions, but are useful when navigating the file system to multiple paths. In addition to tabs, the file navigation history of the current ranger session is saved to allow traversal to recently accessed directories. By default, ranger shows the number and the file name of the buffer as a tab. This can be adjusted by modifying the ranger-tabs-style variable.

Keybinding      Description
gn      create a new tab
gT      go to previous tab
gt      go to next tab
gc      close current tab
zz      search through history
H       history back
L       history next
Copy and Paste Functionality

Ranger utilizes a copy ring to save a persistent fileset that can then be either moved or copied to a target directory. This is consistent with the way the ranger file manager manages file movement. yy specifies to copy the marked or currently hovered files. Additionally a flag denoted as "P" will visually indicate what files are marked for movement. dd likewise specifies that the files will be moved instead of copied.

Using the universal prefix <C-u> prior to this binding will update the selected files to the current copy register. To check the files in the current copy ring, press p?.

To paste the files most recently added to the copy ring, use pp or po to paste. The latter binding will overwrite existing files.

Keybinding      Description
yy      mark files to copy
dd      mark files to move
pp      paste files in copy ring
po      paste files in copy ring and overwrite existing
p?      show the copy contents
Selected File Actions

There are additional features to allow one to open a file or directory while maintaining the previously selected window before ranger is initiated. These keys will open the current file or all the marked files as described below. In the case of running this in deer, the deer window will not close and a new split / frame will be added as described. This allows the creation of an additional deer window if the currently selected file is also a directory for dual pane usage.

Keybinding      Description
ws      exit ranger and open selected file in vertical split
wv      exit ranger and open selected file in horizontal split
wf      exit ranger and open selected file in new frame
we      open the selected file in external app
File Sorting and Listing

Ranger uses dired's default sorting mechanism, but also adds some additional functionality. The default listing switches supplied to dired can be adjusted using the ranger-listing-switches parameter. Once set, all ranger windows will show these parameters.

Additionally, the dired buffer is modified to sort directories to the top. If this is not the desired functionality, the user can change ranger-listing-dir-first.

The o key provides sorting options for the current buffer. In cases when the variable ranger-persistent-sort is set, this sorting method is used for all other ranger buffers.

Troubleshooting and Package Workarounds

Ranger.el needs to control all window placement when open to ensure the parent / primary / preview windows are placed properly and updated upon file movement. As such, there are some known issues with certain packages when they attempt to control window placement while ranger is initialized.

helm-descbinds

This package defaults to opening a helm window with all available bindings in one-window. This causes conflicts with ranger, but there is a workaround.

(setq helm-descbinds-window-style 'same-window)
Configuration

Most parameters can be toggled on and off and stay within the current emacs session. Any settings that are desired on startup should be set below.

Buffer Management

When disabling the mode you can choose to kill the buffers that were opened while browsing the directories.

(setq ranger-cleanup-on-disable t)
Or you can choose to kill the buffer just after you move to another entry in the dired buffer.

(setq ranger-cleanup-eagerly t)
Directory Listing

You can choose to show dotfiles at ranger startup, toggled by zh.

(setq ranger-show-dotfiles t)
Window Decoration and Appearance

Ranger by default modifies the header-line in dired to make a more consistent appearance to the real ranger. Setting to nil will disable this feature.

(setq ranger-modify-header t)
Define custom function used to output header of primary ranger window. Must return a string that is placed in the header-line.

(setq ranger-header-func 'ranger-header-line)
Define custom function used to output header of parent and preview windows. Must return a string that is placed in the header-line.

(setq ranger-parent-header-func 'ranger-parent-header-line)
(setq ranger-preview-header-func 'ranger-preview-header-line)
The cursor can also be hidden for a seamless user experience showing just the cursor line. This feature can be disabled in the cases for themes that do not have a visible cursor line

(setq ranger-hide-cursor nil)
Delays

Certain window display options are defined with a delay for a better user experience. The below options can be customized to adjust time to display the preview and the footer information.

(setq ranger-footer-delay 0.2)
(setq ranger-preview-delay 0.040)
Parent Window Options

You can set the number of folders to nest to the left, adjusted by z- and z+.

(setq ranger-parent-depth 2)
You can set the size of the parent windows as a fraction of the frame size.

(setq ranger-width-parents 0.12)
When increasing number of nested parent folders, set max width as fraction of frame size to prevent filling up entire frame with parents.

(setq ranger-max-parent-width 0.12)
Preview Window Options

Set the default preference to preview selected file.

(setq ranger-preview-file t)
You can choose to show previews literally, or through find-file, toggled by zi.

(setq ranger-show-literal t)
You can set the size of the preview windows as a fraction of the frame size.

(setq ranger-width-preview 0.55)
You probably don't want to open certain files like videos when previewing. To ignore certain files when moving over them you can customize the following to your liking:

(setq ranger-excluded-extensions '("mkv" "iso" "mp4"))
To set the max files size (in MB), set the following parameter:

(setq ranger-max-preview-size 10)
The preview function is also able to determine if the file selected is a binary file. If set to t, these files will not be previewed.

(setq ranger-dont-show-binary t)

2.3.2 Initial visibility

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible1. This can be configured through the variable org-startup-folded, or on a per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything
#+END_EXAMPLE

The startup visibility options are ignored when the file is open for the first time during the agenda generation: if you want the agenda to honor the startup visibility, set org-agenda-inhibit-startup to nil.

Furthermore, any entries with a ‘VISIBILITY’ property (see Properties and columns) will get their visibility adapted accordingly. Allowed values for this property are folded, children, content, and all.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-u C-u <TAB>     (org-set-startup-visibility)
#+END_EXAMPLE
