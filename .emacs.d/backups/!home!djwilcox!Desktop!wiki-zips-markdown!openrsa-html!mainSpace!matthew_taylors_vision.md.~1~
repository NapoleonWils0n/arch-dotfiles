*Email from Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the RSA, to Fellows
September 6 2007*\
Dear Fellow\
\
I hope many of you will have heard my thoughts on the core purpose of
the RSA and its Fellowship from the Journal, my blog, various speeches
and through other channels. However, I felt it was important to write
now to all RSA Fellows to outline the significance of the changes we are
embarking upon, and to provide you with a little more background.\
\
In essence, our aim is that the RSA becomes a network for civic
innovation, empowering both Fellows and staff to develop new initiatives
that promote and deliver progress in society. We want to make it easier
for any Fellow who wants to get involved to connect with other
like-minded Fellows and to develop initiatives that seek to remove
barriers to progress, working locally, in professional groups or simply
among people who share interests and enthusiasms.\
\
This is a huge step, arguably one of the biggest in our illustrious
history. Whilst individual Fellows have actively engaged with the work
of the RSA, the experience of most Fellows has tended to be more
passive. You’ve told us you want that to change, so the plan is to bring
the Fellows from the periphery to the heart of the RSA’s activities. The
role of the team at John Adam Street will be to enable and empower
Fellows to be a force for progress. If we get this right, we will be
breaking new ground and hope to draw invaluable lessons about how
voluntary networks can best deliver positive interventions in society.\
\
Throughout this process so far, we have had invaluable advice and
support from Fellows, and we are confident that we can establish the
right mix of tools and support to enable Fellows’ networks to develop
and flourish. If we are to succeed it means having new ideas, testing
those ideas out, turning them into plans for action and then making
change real. It is this combination of hard edged critical thinking and
innovation with commitment and perseverance that will be the hardest
challenge.\
\
Towards the end of November, we plan to fill the RSA House in London for
a day with a cross-section of Fellows – about 1% of the total – to begin
working through the implications and applications of this idea.\
\
Not all Fellows can fit into the House on the one day, but I want as
many Fellows as possible to be part of this change. If you have comments
or ideas, simply reply to this e-mail. There will be many opportunities
to get involved over the coming months and we will keep you all updated
on our progress through the Fellowship section of the website and the
Journal.\
