1.  I am hoping that, rather than forming too much of a set of concrete
    individual wishes in advance, people will come along with their own
    ideas and aspirations, and then share them with others, work
    together…
2.  …and be pleasantly *surprised* at the result.

\
**Lizzie Jackson**\
1.  Gathering together all the things that have been learnt about the
    RSA/RSA fellowship and on and off-line networks over the last
    eighteen months (contributions coming from the RSA, NESTA
    and OpenRSA).
2.  Visualising, expressing, and identifying concrete steps towards
    making that happen.

\
**Fred Garnett**\
1.  looking to review what has developed with OpenRSA over the past year
    and agreeing some operating principles for the network, probably
    built around conversations.
2.  look at ways of utilising or developing an RSA Network which can be
    a resource we can all share in developing a Knowledge Democracy,
    probably through the development of local projects which could use
    the network as a source of expertise and support; Personally I am
    interested in developing what I call “Citizen-Generated Contexts”

\
**Mike Amos-Simpson**\
1.  Like others I’m generally interested in the idea of online
    collaborations - not just the technical side but also what
    consideration is given to things like dynamics, facilitation and
    similar (the stuff that maybe people assume you have to meet face to
    face for)
2.  Out of this I hope eventually to get something useful from being
    involved with RSA - it would be nice if this was a good online
    aspect, but failing that meeting some interesting people will do!

\
**Christy Avraam**\
1.  I am coming to see if there is a better way I can start to build
    working relationships/collaborations with other professionals
    through the RSA.
2.  I want to see if there is a way I can make connections with other
    fellows that will enable me to bring more Art into the lives
    of others.

\
**David Wilcox**\
1.  we’ll get some really clear indication of what RSA plans to offer
    Fellows in future for our £140. Currently events are open to all,
    facilities are limited, anyone can join and be “FRSA” Or is it the
    other way around, and we are supporting RSA? For what? Is the civic
    innovation vision dead? And so on :-)
2.  I hope we will, in any case, find some shared interest with someone
    else present in developing a project. My interest is communication
    toolkits for online/offline activity to help members of any
    organisation collaborate more effectively.

\
**Jemima Gibbons**\
1.  I’m coming along because I’m writing a book on the impact of social
    media on leadership, so interested to see how social media can help
    (or hinder?) an organisation such as the RSA.
2.  I’m hoping to meet other Fellows, identify the key problems/
    benefits in establishing an online network and - hopefully - agree
    on the best way to do it.

\
**Alan Patrick**\
1.  I have been involved in OpenRSA since its inception, its a
    fascinating experiment
2.  I believe social media is a tool with extremely high potential to
    help restructure society in a more democratic and transparent way,
    but also has major risks - and I want to have input to that
    great debate. We are a consultancy with a lot of skill/experience in
    this space so also see opportunity to help and learn at the
    same time.

\
**Sian Prime**\
1.  I think the RSA is an amazing network of people, people with
    expertise, strong social conscience and generosity, I want to be
    part of this initiative that will help people connect and access
    more connections.
2.  I work in the field of supporting creative and social innovation and
    enterprise, it feels like this network can make a big impact, either
    directly through the RSA or through the Fellow’s own work outwith
    the RSA, and I want to see how we can ensure that is maximised.

\
**Laura Bunt**\
1.  To share ideas, thoughts and aspirations for how the key learnings
    from the evaluation, RSA event in Manchester and Open RSA/Networks
    work last year can be embedded into the fabric of the RSA and share
    recent developments and priorities for the Fellowship team towards
    turning this into a reality.
2.  To work towards developing a ‘tool kit’ that creates and supports
    the right conditions for Fellows’ networks and turning ideas into
    practical actions.
