**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This was the initial About
statement for OpenRSA 2007-2009</span>**\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The idea of OpenRSA developed
from some [blog
posts](http://www.designingforcivilsociety.org/rsa/index.html){.wiki_link_ext},
a
[get-together](http://twopointouch.com/2007/07/10/rsa-and-social-media/){.wiki_link_ext}
of about a dozen people in July 2007, and discussion in a[Facebook
group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3220240315){.wiki_link_ext}.
The trigger was plans under development by Matthew Taylor,
newly-appointed chief executive of the
[RSA](http://www.thersa.org/){.wiki_link_ext}, to re-invent the
organisation. Ian Delaney summarised the challenge in his [blog
post:](http://twopointouch.com/2007/07/10/rsa-and-social-media/){.wiki_link_ext}</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"The RSA is the Royal Society
for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce. Established 250
years ago, it currently has about 26,500 Fellows. They can attend a very
full and well-attended events schedule; they get the letters FRSA after
their name; there’s no shortage of applications for its paid membership.
Business is booming. And yet there’s a little bit of a problem.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The Society’s problem is that
times have changed. Fellows are apparently expressing some degree of
disgruntlement that they don’t feel involved with the programme or the
Society. While in the past, a programme of well-planned lectures from
eminent persons, nice premises on the Strand and a learned journal
several times a year seemed satisfactory, that’s no longer enough.
Today’s younger members want projects they can join, causes they can
work with and more of a say, arguably, in what’s happening at the
Society. There’s a feeling of empty hands that want to be
filled.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How can the RSA make Fellows
feel more involved, develop and encourage projects that engage members
at the grass roots level, rather than merely being part of the audience
listening to someone from the stage in the Grand Hall of its London
HQ?"</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The group meeting in July was
in favour of Matthew’s vision, and felt the process of reinvention would
benefit from direct input from Fellows (the members of the RSA) and
others who might be interested. We were particularly interested in how
to use social media as part of the process, linked with face-to-face
meetings.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Discussion continued in the
OpenRSA Facebook group, where a small group of those involved decided to
organise an open event on October 1 2007, in advance of an event being
planned by Matthew and RSA staff in November. The aim was to help set
the style and agenda from the Fellow’s perspective, and so make a
positive contribution to the process of re-invention. On September 6
2007 Matthew Taylor emailed all 26,500 Fellows confirming his vision,
and saying he would like about 1 percent of them to attend an event at
RSA in November. You can [read the email
here](http://openrsa.wikispaces.com/Matthew+Taylor%27s+vision){.wiki_link}.
Matthew wrote:</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“In essence, our aim is that
the RSA becomes a network for civic innovation, empowering both Fellows
and staff to develop new initiatives that promote and deliver progress
in society. We want to make it easier for any Fellow who wants to get
involved to connect with other like-minded Fellows and to develop
initiatives that seek to remove barriers to progress, working locally,
in professional groups or simply among people who share interests and
enthusiasms.”</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The email arrived just as the
OpenRSA group were planning to open their discussions up beyond
Facebook, by creating an email/web discussion forum using a Google
groups. You can [join up to it
here.](http://groups.google.com/group/openrsa){.wiki_link_ext}</span>\
\
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">So what is the
OpenRSA?</span>**\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The precise form of OpenRSA
will emerge from further discussions. Here’s how Malcolm Forbes put it
in the introduction to the Facebook group:</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"Welcome to the Open RSA London
group. This is a group for all those interested in the RSA, its people,
its projects, its aims, its challenges, its vision. This is an open
group, anyone can join, not just ‘fellows’ or staff of the RSA, but we
would like as many of them as possible to join in.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For starters we would encourage
you to post to the For Openers Discussion thread below.</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">"This group is exploratory -
seeing what value can emerge from the use of social networking software
such as Facebook.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We have started as a London
group but again you can still be a member if you are not in London. We
want to encourage discussion, ideas, action, meetings and linkages to
other networks and groups. Maybe other Open RSA groups set up in other
areas.</span>\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The RSA by the way is the Royal
Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce and
‘works to remove the barriers to social progress’. Lets see what happens
and also have some fun!"</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The initial group is very
conscious that so far discussion has been mainly among people in London,
and will be making an effort to contact other RSA Fellows around the
country.</span>\
\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We expect new directions for
OpenRSA to emerge from discussions at the workshop on Febnruary 19 2009.

\
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">OpenRSA online</span>**\
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">One of the main interests of
those starting OpenRSA is the use of social media, and in particular
online tools available to anyone free or at low cost. For that reason we
are using Facebook, Google and Wikispaces. We’ll add others as
necessary.</span>\
\
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Update</span>**<span
style="background-color: #ffffff;">: OpenRSA has now set up an online
network
[http://openrsa.ning.com](http://openrsa.ning.com/){.wiki_link_ext}that
will replace most of the other online tools set up in 2007. Although
created by RSA Fellows, it is open to friends and staff.</span>\
