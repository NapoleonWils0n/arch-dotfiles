## []()RSA Fellows’ Digital Engagement Strategy \[DRAFT\] {#toc0}

### []()1. Background {#toc1}

The internet offers a wealth of opportunity for any group committed to
doing social good. As documented in a number of books, articles and web
pages, the ability for people with common interests to self organise to
get things done presents a major shift in the way civic activity is
performed.\
This has repercussions for a number of actors within society, not least
membership based organisations such as the RSA. If people can congregate
around an issue by creating a group on Meetup, or Facebook, or by simply
using a common tag on Twitter, what is the value-add from having to pay
an organisation to be a member?\
The RSA corporately is figuring out this conundrum under the banner of
21st Century Enlightenment, and is engaged in using a lot of online
technology, such as blogs, Twitter and Ning groups to spread the word
about its activities and to encourage new fellows to sign up. There have
also been attempts to provide platforms for fellows to connect with one
another and to organise into groups on the basis on issues or locality.\
In addition to this, a group of web-savvy fellows created an informal
group called OpenRSA, with the aim of exploring how far self-organising
could go for fellows, and how online developments affected the
relationship between the RSA and its fellows.\
The result of all this activity was the creation of several groups,
mostly location based, using the free Ning platform. There is also the
RSA Fellowship Council Ning site, which has the vast majority of
activity. The proliferation of these free networks have demonstrated
both the clear need fellows have for places where they can network
online; but also the difficulties of managing multiple online spaces and
keeping everyone up to date with their content.\
### []()2. About this strategy {#toc2}

This is a digital engagement strategy for fellows, and not for the RSA
as a corporate body. This strategy identifies the challenges facing
fellows in their attempts to use the internet to help them communicate
and collaborate with other fellows, and then sets out what needs to
happen to meet those challenges. This takes the form of activities and
roles.\
### []()3. What this strategy does not cover {#toc3}

This strategy is for the fellows, and not for the RSA as a corporate
body. Therefore, it is not concerned with explicitly promoting the RSA,
it’s activities or fellowship (although those things may be by-products
of this strategy). It also does not cover technology issues which are
the responsibility of the RSA and which could not conceivably be
undertaken by fellows alone - such as the membership directory project,
for example.\
### []()4. Mission {#toc4}

This strategy sets out how fellows can use online technology to
complement their activities and to create more connections and
conversations between fellows. The strategy will enable fellows to play
an active and influential role in the virtual communities which are
growing in importance throughout civil society.\
### []()5. Challenges {#toc5}

-   It is difficult for fellows to find one another, whether in terms of
    common issues and interests or locality
-   Not all fellows are up to speed with the latest online developments
-   Fellows do not feel empowered to start projects under their own
    steam
-   Online discussions are fragmented across sites and systems
-   Nobody is responsible for any one element of digital engagement
    activity

### []()6. Objectives {#toc6}

To meet the challenges, fellows need to achieve the following
objectives:\
\
-   To ensure all fellows who wish to engage online have the skills to
    feel comfortable in doing so
-   To identify a suite of online tools that can help facilitate
    fellows’ online activities
-   To ensure fellows can play an active part in the various ongoing
    civic digital initiatives
-   \

\
### []()7. Activities {#toc7}

**Connect with both RSA corporate and Fellowship activities**\
\
-   Follow what is happening across corporate and Fellowship sites -
    e.g. dashboard
-   Find and sign up for both corporate and Fellow-organised events

\
**Publish**\
-   Post blog items, videos, photos

\
**Network and collaborate**\
-   Find other like-minded Fellows
-   Set up affinity groups and discussions
-   Set up project groups to work together
-   Invite people to Fellow-organised events

\
**Support other Fellows**\
-   Join a skills bank linked to the Catalyst project programme

### []()8. Roles {#toc8}

-   Campaign strategist - not sure if we need this one really
-   Community manager - people with an oversight of the whole community,
    promote it through their networks, introduce new people to the
    community
-   Social media developer - people with the technical skills to set up
    online tools, and to hack existing ones to meet the needs of fellows
-   Digital mentor - fellows with skills and knowledge with digital
    technology and are happy and able to pass these onto others
-   Social reporter
-   Digital curator / gardener - people who can track conversations in a
    number of spaces and bring them together. Some overlap with social
    reporter? See reporters as creating content rather than organising
    it?

### []()9. Technology {#toc9}

Any technology solution for the fellows needs to incorporate the
following features. This not not need to all be in the same platform.
Instead, a variety of tools could be identified for fellows to use to
ensure all needs are met. Some of these, on reflection, might not be
needed at all!\
\
-   Fellow profiles, listing details like name, contacts, interests,
    skills, knowledge etc
-   Themed discussion areas
-   Collaborative authoring - fellows working together on online
    documents
-   E-learning - sharing skills and knowledge online with other fellows
    (and indeed anyone else)
-   Online conferencing including live audio, video and text based
    discussions

\
What’s more, the technology used by fellows should, where possible, be:\
-   Sustainable - it should be low cost or free, and likely to remain so
    in the future
-   Scalable - it should be able to cope with large amounts of activity
    and users, etc
-   Replicable - where a technology works well in one scenario, it
    should be easily replicated to work in others
-   Open data - it should be easy to extract user data and content from
    the technology to set up elsewhere if necessary
-   Open source - it is preferable to use open source technology where
    possible, especially if using a self-hosted system rather than
    software-as-a-service
