[2016-08-07 Sun 15:55] Emacs as Daemon on OS X using Launchd

If you’re running Emacs 23, you can run Emacs As Daemon via OS X’s launchd. The easiest solution is to use a tool like Lingon to create the plist file or can create one manually like this:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> 
     <plist version="1.0">
      <dict> 
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>gnu.emacs.daemon</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs</string>
          <string>--daemon</string>
        </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>ServiceDescription</key>
       <string>Gnu Emacs Daemon</string>
       <key>UserName</key>
       <string>[YOUR USERNAME HERE]</string>
      </dict>
    </plist>
This can then be installed in /Library/LaunchAgents and loaded via:

    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist

Try changing to ownership of the .plist file, as noted here.

sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
sudo chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist
It is also worth noting that these root LaunchDaemons can't be world writable, for security reasons:

sudo chmod o-w /Library/LaunchDaemons/*

Can also be done with a single command: sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/myfile.plist – Eric Mar 25 at 16:06
